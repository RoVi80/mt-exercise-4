L@@ ast year I showed these two sli@@ des so that demonstr@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 stat@@ es, has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent.
But this underst@@ ates the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice.
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is, in a sense, the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system.
It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and con@@ trac@@ ts in summ@@ er.
The next slide I show you will be a ra@@ pid fa@@ st-@@ forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red.
As you see, it exp@@ ands to the dark blue --
that's the ann@@ ual ice in w@@ inter@@ , and it con@@ trac@@ ts in summ@@ er.
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice, five years old or ol@@ der, you can see is almost like bloo@@ d, sp@@ illing out of the body here.
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
This is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an, where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which, when it th@@ aw@@ s, is turned into me@@ than@@ e by micro@@ b@@ es.
Com@@ par@@ ed to the total amount of global war@@ ming pol@@ lu@@ tion in the atmosp@@ here, that amount could dou@@ ble if we c@@ ross this ti@@ pping point.
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in Al@@ as@@ k@@ a, me@@ than@@ e is ac@@ tively bub@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water.
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ ate@@ y Wal@@ ter from the University of Al@@ as@@ k@@ a went out with another team to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last w@@ inter@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o: Wh@@ o@@ a@@ ! Al G@@ ore@@ : She's oka@@ y. The question is whether we will be.
And one reason is, this enormous heat s@@ ink he@@ ats up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th.
This is an ann@@ ual mel@@ ting ri@@ ver.
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than ever.
This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in sou@@ th@@ w@@ est Gre@@ en@@ land.
If you want to know how sea level ri@@ ses from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it reach@@ es the se@@ a.
These flow@@ s are increas@@ ing very rap@@ id@@ ly.
At the other end of the planet, An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of ice on the planet.
L@@ ast month scientists repor@@ ted the entire contin@@ ent is now in neg@@ ative ice bal@@ ance. And w@@ est An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea is@@ land@@ s, is particularly ra@@ pid in its mel@@ ting.
That's equ@@ al to 20 feet of sea level, as is Gre@@ en@@ land.
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as, the third largest mass of ic@@ e: at the top you see new la@@ k@@ es, which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers.
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flow@@ .
In the An@@ d@@ es, this gl@@ aci@@ er is the source of dr@@ in@@ king water for this city.
The flow@@ s have incre@@ a@@ sed.
But when they go away, so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water.
In Californi@@ a there has been a 40 percent dec@@ line in the Si@@ err@@ a s@@ now@@ pac@@ k.
This is h@@ itting the re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.
And the predic@@ tions, as you've rea@@ d, are seri@@ ous.
This dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dram@@ atic increase in fi@@ re@@ s.
And the disa@@ sters around the world have been increas@@ ing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ented r@@ ate.
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the previ@@ ous 7@@ 5.
This is a completely un@@ sustainable patter@@ n.
If you look at in the contex@@ t of history you can see what this is doing.
In the last five years we've ad@@ ded 70 million tons of CO@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oce@@ ans.
Look care@@ fully at the area of the ea@@ ster@@ n P@@ aci@@ fic@@ , from the Americ@@ as, ext@@ ending we@@ st@@ war@@ d, and on either side of the Indian sub@@ contin@@ ent, where there is a ra@@ d@@ ical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oce@@ ans.
The biggest single cause of global warm@@ ing, along with de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation, which is 20 percent of it, is the bur@@ ning of fo@@ ssi@@ l fu@@ el@@ s.
O@@ il is a problem, and co@@ al is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters, along with Chin@@ a.
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al plan@@ ts.
But we're beginning to see a sea change.
Here are the ones that have been canc@@ ell@@ ed in the last few years with some green altern@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ po@@ sed.
How@@ ever there is a political batt@@ le in our country.
And the co@@ al industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ en@@ da@@ r year prom@@ o@@ ting clean co@@ al, which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on.
That image re@@ min@@ ded me of something.
A@@ round Christ@@ ma@@ s, in my home in T@@ enn@@ es@@ see, a billion gall@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ led.
You probably saw it on the new@@ s.
Th@@ is, all over the country, is the second largest waste st@@ ream in America.
This happened around Christ@@ mas@@ .
One of the co@@ al industr@@ y's ad@@ s around Christ@@ m@@ as was this one.
V@@ ide@@ o: ♪@@ ♫ Fro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is a j@@ ol@@ ly, happy s@@ oul@@ .
He's ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant here in America, and he helps our economy grow@@ .
Fro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is getting cle@@ an@@ er every@@ day.
He's affor@@ d@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able, and work@@ ers keep their pa@@ y.
Al G@@ ore@@ : This is the source of much of the co@@ al in West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a.
The largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of M@@ asse@@ y Co@@ al.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ on B@@ lan@@ k@@ en@@ shi@@ p@@ : Let me be clear about it. Al G@@ ore@@ , N@@ ancy Pe@@ lo@@ si@@ , Har@@ ry R@@ ei@@ d, they don't know what they're talking about.
Al G@@ ore@@ : So the Al@@ li@@ ance for C@@ lim@@ ate Pro@@ tec@@ tion has laun@@ ched two campa@@ ig@@ n@@ s.
This is one of them, part of one of them.
V@@ ide@@ o: Ac@@ tor@@ : At CO@@ A@@ L@@ erg@@ y we view climate change as a very serious thre@@ at to our business.
That's why we've made it our primar@@ y goal to spend a large sum of money on an adver@@ ti@@ sing eff@@ ort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about co@@ al.
The fact is, co@@ al isn't di@@ r@@ ty.
We think it's clean -- sm@@ ell@@ s good, too.
So don't worry about climate change.
Le@@ a@@ ve that up to us.
V@@ ide@@ o: Ac@@ tor@@ : C@@ le@@ an co@@ al -- you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a t@@ our of this st@@ ate@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art clean co@@ al fac@@ il@@ ity.
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ! The machin@@ ery is kind of lou@@ d. But that's the sound of clean co@@ al technology.
And while bur@@ ning co@@ al is one of the leading causes of global warm@@ ing, the remarkable clean co@@ al technology you see here changes everything.
Take a good long loo@@ k@@ : this is toda@@ y's clean co@@ al technology.
Al G@@ ore@@ : Fin@@ ally, the positive altern@@ ative mes@@ h@@ es with our economic challenge and our national security challeng@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: N@@ arr@@ ator@@ : America is in cri@@ sis -- the econom@@ y, national secur@@ ity, the climate crisi@@ s.
The thre@@ ad that lin@@ ks them all@@ : our ad@@ dic@@ tion to carbon based fu@@ el@@ s, like di@@ r@@ ty co@@ al and fore@@ ign o@@ il.
But now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess.
R@@ ep@@ ow@@ er America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years.
A plan to put America back to work, make us more sec@@ ure@@ , and help stop global warm@@ ing.
Fin@@ ally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.
R@@ ep@@ ow@@ er America. F@@ ind out more.
Al G@@ ore@@ : This is the last one.
V@@ ide@@ o: N@@ arr@@ ator@@ : It's about re@@ power@@ ing America.
One of the fast@@ est ways to cut our depend@@ ence on old di@@ r@@ ty fu@@ els that are k@@ illing our planet.
Man: F@@ u@@ ture@@ 's over here. W@@ in@@ d, sun@@ , a new energy gri@@ d.
M@@ an #@@ 2@@ : New invest@@ ments to create high-@@ paying job@@ s.
N@@ arr@@ ator@@ : R@@ ep@@ ow@@ er America. It's time to get real@@ .
Al G@@ ore@@ : There is an old African pro@@ ver@@ b that says, "If you want to go quick@@ ly, go al@@ one.
If you want to go far@@ , go toge@@ ther@@ ."
We need to go far@@ , quickly.
Thank you very much.
L@@ ast year at TED I gave an introduc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C.
And I prom@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that machine wor@@ ked.
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there, the L@@ H@@ C is the largest scientific experiment ever attem@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 kilome@@ ters in circ@@ um@@ fer@@ ence.
I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe be@@ gan@@ , up to 6@@ 00 million times a secon@@ d.
It's nothing if not am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous.
This is the machine below Gen@@ ev@@ a.
We take the pictures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ Big Bang@@ s inside detec@@ tor@@ s.
This is the one I work on. It's called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S detec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wid@@ e, 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in diam@@ e@@ ter.
S@@ pec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under construc@@ tion so you can see the scal@@ e.
On the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we turned the machine on for the first time.
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S.
It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se celebr@@ ation in the control room.
It's a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C@@ , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C deli@@ ber@@ ately, and show@@ ering particles into the detec@@ tor.
In other words, when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 10@@ th we knew the machine wor@@ ked, which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph@@ .
I don't know whether this got the biggest che@@ er, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that.
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impac@@ t.
Ab@@ out a week later we had a problem with the machin@@ e, related actually to these bits of w@@ ire here -- these go@@ ld wire@@ s.
Those wi@@ res carry 1@@ 3 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power.
Now the engine@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say, "@@ No they don@@ 't. They're small wi@@ res@@ ."
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what's called super@@ conduc@@ ting wi@@ re.
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degre@@ es, col@@ der than the space between the star@@ s, those wi@@ res can take that curr@@ ent.
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in L@@ H@@ C@@ , there was a manufac@@ tur@@ ing def@@ ec@@ t.
So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up sli@@ ght@@ ly, and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps suddenly enc@@ oun@@ ter@@ ed electr@@ ical re@@ sist@@ ance.
This was the resul@@ t.
Now that's more impres@@ sive when you consider those magne@@ ts we@@ igh over 20 t@@ ons, and they moved about a foo@@ t.
So we dam@@ aged about 50 of the magne@@ ts.
We had to take them out, which we did.
We re@@ conditi@@ on@@ ed them all, fix@@ ed them.
They're all on their way back under@@ ground now.
By the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be int@@ act again.
We will swit@@ ch it on, and we expect to take data in J@@ une or J@@ ul@@ y, and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building bloc@@ ks of the universe are.
Now of course, in a way those accid@@ ents re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the deb@@ ate about the value of science and engineering at the ed@@ ge. It's easy to ref@@ ut@@ e.
I think that the fact that it's so difficul@@ t, the fact that we're over@@ reach@@ ing, is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C.
I will leave the final word to an English scienti@@ st, Hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y, wh@@ o, I sus@@ pec@@ t, when def@@ ending his prote@@ ge@@ 's use@@ less experim@@ ents -- his prote@@ ge was Micha@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ ay -- said this, "@@ No@@ thing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assum@@ e that our view@@ s of science are ultim@@ ate, that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature, that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te, and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er@@ ."
Thank you.
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a ki@@ d, playing with bloc@@ ks.
As you figured out how to reach out and gr@@ as@@ p, pick them up and move them around, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and man@@ ip@@ ul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relationshi@@ ps.
S@@ pati@@ al reason@@ ing is deep@@ ly connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as a computer scienti@@ st inspired by this u@@ til@@ ity of our interac@@ tions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vi@@ se@@ r P@@ at@@ ti@@ e, and my collabor@@ ator J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a compu@@ ter, instead of having this one mou@@ se cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a digital fing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top@@ , what if we could reach in with both hands and gr@@ as@@ p information phys@@ ically,
arr@@ ang@@ ing it the way we wan@@ te@@ d?
This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we decided to explore the answ@@ er, by building S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les.
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell, a S@@ if@@ table is an interac@@ tive computer
the size of a coo@@ ki@@ e.
They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their mo@@ tion, and they have a screen and a wire@@ less radi@@ o.
Most important@@ ly, they're phys@@ ical, so like the bloc@@ ks, you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gr@@ asp@@ ing.
And S@@ if@@ t@@ ables are an example of a new eco@@ system of tools for man@@ ip@@ ul@@ ating digital information.
And as these tools become more phys@@ ical, more aware of their mo@@ tion, aware of each other, and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun inter@@ action sty@@ les.
So, I'm going to start with some simple example@@ s.
This S@@ if@@ table is con@@ figured to show vide@@ o, and if I til@@ t it in one direc@@ tion, it'll ro@@ ll the video this wa@@ y; if I til@@ t it the other way it rol@@ ls it back@@ war@@ ds.
And these interac@@ tive por@@ tra@@ its are aware of each other.
So if I put them next to each other, they get interest@@ ed.
If they get surr@@ oun@@ ded, they notice that too,
they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed.
And they can also sense their mo@@ tion and til@@ t.
One of the interesting implic@@ ations on interac@@ tion, we started to realiz@@ e, was that we could use every@@ day ge@@ stu@@ res on data, like p@@ our@@ ing a color the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qui@@ d.
So in this case, we've got three S@@ if@@ t@@ ables con@@ figured to be pain@@ t buc@@ ke@@ ts and I can use them to p@@ our color into that central one,
where they get mix@@ ed.
If we over@@ shoo@@ t, we can p@@ our a little bit back.
There are also some ne@@ at possibil@@ ities for education, like langu@@ age, math and logi@@ c games where we want to give people the ability to try things quick@@ ly, and view the results immedi@@ at@@ ely.
So here I'm --
This is a Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequ@@ ence that I'm making with a simple equ@@ ation program@@ .
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and Bo@@ gg@@ le.
Bas@@ ically, in every round you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned let@@ ter on each S@@ if@@ t@@ able, and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary.
Th@@ en, after about 30 secon@@ ds, it re@@ sh@@ u@@ ff@@ les, and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new possibil@@ ities to tr@@ y.
Thank you.
So these are some kids that came on a field tri@@ p to the Me@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I man@@ aged to get them to try it out, and shoo@@ t a vide@@ o.
They really loved it.
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of applic@@ ation is that you don't have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions.
All you have to say is, "@@ Ma@@ ke wor@@ d@@ s@@ ," and they know exactly what to do.
So here's another few people trying it out.
That's our youn@@ gest bet@@ a te@@ st@@ er, down there on the right.
Tur@@ ns out, all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the S@@ if@@ t@@ ables up.
So to him, they were just bloc@@ ks.
Now, this is an interac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on applic@@ ation.
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ n@@ ers. And this is Fe@@ li@@ x, actu@@ ally.
And he can bring new charac@@ ters into the scen@@ e,
just by lif@@ ting the S@@ if@@ t@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them.
Her@@ e, he's bringing the sun out.
V@@ ide@@ o: The sun is ris@@ ing.
David M@@ err@@ ill@@ : Now he's brought a trac@@ tor into the scen@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: The or@@ ange trac@@ tor.
Good job@@ ! Yea@@ h@@ !
D@@ M: So by sha@@ king the S@@ if@@ t@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the charac@@ ters interact --
V@@ ide@@ o: W@@ oo@@ f@@ !
D@@ M: invent@@ ing his own n@@ arr@@ ati@@ ve.
V@@ ide@@ o: H@@ el@@ lo@@ !
D@@ M: It's an open@@ -@@ ended story,
and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds.
V@@ ide@@ o: F@@ ly away, cat@@ .
D@@ M: So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ enc@@ ing and live perform@@ ance tool
that we've built rec@@ ently,
in which S@@ if@@ t@@ ables act as sounds like lea@@ d, bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s.
Each of these has four different vari@@ ations, you get to choose which one you want to use.
And you can in@@ jec@@ t these sounds into a sequ@@ ence that you can assem@@ ble into the pattern that you want.
And you in@@ jec@@ t it by just b@@ um@@ ping up the sound S@@ if@@ table against a sequ@@ ence S@@ if@@ table.
There are effec@@ ts that you can control li@@ ve, like rever@@ b and fil@@ ter.
You att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then til@@ t to ad@@ just it.
And then, over@@ all effec@@ ts like tem@@ p@@ o and vol@@ um@@ e that apply to the entire sequ@@ ence.
So let's have a loo@@ k.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: We@@ 'll start by putting a lead into two sequ@@ ence S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les, arr@@ ange them into a seri@@ es, ext@@ end it, add a little more lea@@ d.
Now I put a bas@@ s line in.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: Now I'll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ um@@ s, so I can control the effect li@@ ve.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: I can speed up the whole sequ@@ ence by til@@ ting the tem@@ p@@ o one way or the other.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more expres@@ sion.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: I can re@@ arr@@ ange the sequ@@ ence while it play@@ s.
So I don't have to plan it out in adv@@ ance, but I can im@@ provi@@ se, making it longer or shor@@ ter as I go.
And now, finally, I can f@@ ade the whole sequ@@ ence out using the vol@@ um@@ e S@@ if@@ t@@ able, til@@ ted to the left.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my pas@@ sion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bodi@@ es work.
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibil@@ ities that we're working to bring out of the labor@@ ator@@ y.
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for interac@@ ting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our ter@@ ms.
Thank you very much.
I look forward to talking with all of you.
I am a writ@@ er.
W@@ r@@ iting books is my profes@@ sion but it's more than that, of cour@@ se.
It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation.
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
But, that said, something kind of pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my care@@ er, which has ca@@ used me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relationship with this work.
And the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this me@@ mo@@ ir called "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, Lo@@ ve@@ " which, dec@@ ide@@ dly un@@ like any of my previ@@ ous boo@@ ks, went out in the world for some reas@@ on, and became this big, me@@ ga@@ -@@ sens@@ ation, international be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler thing.
The result of which is that every@@ where I go now, people treat me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed.
S@@ eri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ !
Li@@ ke, they come up to me now, all wor@@ ri@@ ed, and they say, "@@ Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to be able to top that?
Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all,
ever again@@ ?"
So that's reas@@ sur@@ ing, you know.
But it would be wor@@ se, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writ@@ er,
I was met with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based reac@@ tion.
And people would say, "@@ Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to have any success@@ ?
Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id the hum@@ i@@ li@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will kill you@@ ?
Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id that you're going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and no@@ thing@@ 's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of bro@@ ken dream@@ s with your m@@ outh filled with bit@@ ter ash of fail@@ ure@@ ?"
Like that, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "@@ Y@@ es."
Yes, I'm af@@ ra@@ id of all those things.
And I always have be@@ en.
And I'm af@@ ra@@ id of many, many more things b@@ es@@ id@@ es that people can't even guess at,
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary.
But, when it comes to writ@@ ing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lat@@ ely, and wonder@@ ing about lat@@ ely, is wh@@ y?
You know, is it r@@ ation@@ al@@ ?
Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be af@@ ra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
And what is it speci@@ f@@ ically about creative vent@@ ure@@ s that seems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other@@ 's mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don't do, you know?
Like my da@@ d, for example, was a chemical engine@@ er and I don't rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was af@@ ra@@ id to be a chemical engine@@ er, you know?
"@@ That chem@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ engineering bloc@@ k, Joh@@ n, how@@ 's it go@@ ing@@ ?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know?
But to be fair@@ , chemical engine@@ ers as a group haven't really ear@@ ned a re@@ put@@ ation over the cent@@ uri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depres@@ si@@ ves.
We writ@@ ers, we kind of do have that re@@ put@@ ation, and not just writ@@ ers, but creative people across all gen@@ re@@ s, it seem@@ s, have this re@@ put@@ ation for being enorm@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able.
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death coun@@ t in the 20@@ th century al@@ one, of really mag@@ nific@@ ent creative minds who died young and often at their own hand@@ s, you know?
And even the ones who didn't literally comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de seem to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ f@@ ts, you know.
Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er, just before he di@@ ed, last inter@@ view, he said, "@@ Every one of my books has killed me a little more@@ ." An extraordinary stat@@ ement to make about your lif@@ e's work.
But we don't even blin@@ k when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely inter@@ n@@ alized and accep@@ ted collec@@ tively this notion that creati@@ vity and suff@@ ering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y, in the end, will always ultim@@ ately lead to angu@@ ish@@ .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that ide@@ a@@ ?
Are you comfor@@ table with that? Because you look at it even from an inc@@ h away and, you know -- I'm not at all comfor@@ table with that assum@@ p@@ tion.
I think it's o@@ di@@ ous.
And I also think it's danger@@ ous, and I don't want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next centur@@ y.
I think it's better if we encou@@ rage our great creative minds to li@@ ve.
And I defin@@ itely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark pat@@ h of assum@@ p@@ tion, particularly given the circ@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I'm in right now in my care@@ er.
Which is -- you know, like check it out, I'm pretty youn@@ g, I'm only about 40 years old.
I still have maybe another four decad@@ es of work left in me.
And it's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be ju@@ dg@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the f@@ rea@@ k@@ ish success of my last book, right?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ t@@ ly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
So J@@ es@@ us, what a thou@@ ght@@ !
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at nine o@@ '@@ clo@@ ck in the morning, and I don't want to go there.
I would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that I love.
And so, the question be@@ com@@ es, how@@ ?
And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflec@@ tion, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writ@@ ing, is that I have to create some sort of protec@@ tive psycho@@ logical construc@@ t, right?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe dist@@ ance between me, as I am writ@@ ing, and my very natural an@@ xi@@ ety about what the re@@ action to that writing is going to be, from now on. And, as I've been loo@@ king, over the last year, for models for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other socie@@ ties to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have
about how to help creative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emotional ris@@ ks of creati@@ v@@ ity.
And that search has led me to ancient Gre@@ ec@@ e and ancient R@@ om@@ e.
So stay with me, because it does cir@@ cle around and back.
But, ancient Gre@@ ec@@ e and ancient R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that creati@@ vity came from human beings back then, OK?
People believed that creati@@ vity was this di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spir@@ it that came to human beings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able sourc@@ e, for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reas@@ ons.
The Gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spir@@ its of creati@@ vity "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s."
S@@ oc@@ r@@ at@@ es, fam@@ ously, believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spo@@ ke wis@@ dom to him from af@@ ar.
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea, but they called that sort of dise@@ m@@ bodi@@ ed creative spir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us.
Which is great@@ , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a particularly cle@@ ver individu@@ al.
They believed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this, sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ ity, who was believed to literally live in the w@@ alls of an arti@@ st@@ 's studi@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f@@ , and who would come out and sort of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bly as@@ si@@ st the arti@@ st with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work.
So brilli@@ ant -- there it is, right there, that dist@@ ance that I'm talking about -- that psycho@@ logical construc@@ t to protect you from the results of your work.
And everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tion@@ ed, right?
So the ancient arti@@ st was protec@@ ted from certain things, like, for example, too much nar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ sm@@ , right?
If your work was brilli@@ ant, you couldn't take all the cre@@ d@@ it for it, everybody knew that you had this dise@@ m@@ bodi@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had helped you.
If your work bom@@ be@@ d, not enti@@ rely your fa@@ ul@@ t, you know?
Every@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of lam@@ e.
And this is how people thought about creati@@ vity in the West for a really long time.
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything change@@ d, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ eri@@ es, and there's no more room for my@@ st@@ ical creature@@ s who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ ine.
And it's the beginning of r@@ ational human@@ ism, and people started to believe that creati@@ vity came completely from the self of the individu@@ al.
And for the first time in history, you start to hear people refer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us, rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us.
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge err@@ or.
You know, I think that allow@@ ing some@@ body, one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like, the ves@@ sel@@ , you know, like the f@@ on@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine, creati@@ ve, un@@ know@@ able, e@@ tern@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a sm@@ id@@ ge too much responsi@@ bility to put on one f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le, human psy@@ ch@@ e.
It's like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun@@ .
It just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s, and it creates all these un@@ man@@ age@@ able expect@@ ations about perform@@ ance.
And I think the pressure of that has been k@@ illing off our arti@@ sts for the last 500 years.
And, if this is tru@@ e, and I think it is tru@@ e, the question be@@ com@@ es, what now@@ ?
Can we do this differ@@ ent@@ l@@ y?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative my@@ ster@@ y.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just er@@ ase 500 years of r@@ ational human@@ istic thought in one 18 minute spe@@ e@@ ch.
And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate scientific sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the notion of, basically, fai@@ ri@@ es who follow people around r@@ ub@@ bing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff.
I'm not, probab@@ ly, going to bring you all along with me on this.
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why no@@ t?
Why not think about it this wa@@ y?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explain@@ ing the ut@@ ter ma@@ dd@@ ening ca@@ pr@@ ici@@ ous@@ ness of the creative process.
A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have r@@ ation@@ ally.
And, in fact, can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ orm@@ al.
I had this enc@@ oun@@ ter recently where I met the extraordinary American po@@ et R@@ uth St@@ one, who's now in her 9@@ 0s, but she's been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in r@@ ural Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a, she would be out working in the fiel@@ ds, and she said she would feel and hear a poe@@ m coming at her from over the landscap@@ e.
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air@@ .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscap@@ e.
And she felt it com@@ ing, because it would sha@@ ke the earth under her fe@@ et.
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "@@ run like h@@ ell@@ ."
And she would run like h@@ ell to the house and she would be getting cha@@ sed by this po@@ em@@ , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a p@@ enc@@ il fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her, she could collec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the p@@ age.
And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she@@ 'd be running and run@@ ning, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poe@@ m would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would continue on across the landscap@@ e, loo@@ king, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would almost mis@@ s it, right?
So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poe@@ m pas@@ ses through her, and she gr@@ ab@@ s a p@@ enc@@ il just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.
She would catch the poe@@ m by its tail@@ , and she would pull it back@@ war@@ ds into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the p@@ age.
And in these inst@@ anc@@ es, the poe@@ m would come up on the page perfect and int@@ act but back@@ war@@ ds, from the last word to the fir@@ st.
So when I heard that I was like -- that's un@@ can@@ n@@ y, that's exactly what my creative process is like.
That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine@@ !
I'm a mu@@ le, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and swe@@ at and lab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly.
But even I, in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness, even I have br@@ us@@ hed up against that thing, at times.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identi@@ f@@ y.
And what is that thing@@ ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our min@@ ds, bu@@ t, in fact, might actually keep us san@@ e?
And for me, the best con@@ tempor@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ician To@@ m W@@ a@@ it@@ s, who I got to inter@@ view several years ago on a magaz@@ ine as@@ sign@@ ment.
And we were talking about this, and you know, T@@ om, for most of his life, he was pretty much the em@@ bodi@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed con@@ tempor@@ ary modern arti@@ st, trying to control and man@@ age and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ control@@ l@@ able creative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were totally inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ ed.
But then he got ol@@ der, he got cal@@ m@@ er, and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les, and this is when it all changed for him.
And he's spe@@ ed@@ ing along@@ , and all of a sudd@@ en he hear@@ s this little f@@ rag@@ ment of me@@ lo@@ d@@ y, that comes into his head as inspir@@ ation often com@@ es, el@@ usi@@ ve and tan@@ tal@@ iz@@ ing, and he wants it, it's gor@@ ge@@ ous, and he long@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a piece of paper@@ , or a p@@ enc@@ il, or a ta@@ pe recor@@ der.
So he starts to feel all of that old an@@ xi@@ ety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song fore@@ ver.
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."
And instead of pan@@ ick@@ ing, he just stop@@ pe@@ d.
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely no@@ vel@@ .
He just looked up at the sk@@ y, and he said, "@@ Ex@@ c@@ use me, can you not see that I'm dri@@ v@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ Do I look like I can write down a song right now@@ ?
If you really want to exist@@ , come back at a more opportun@@ e moment when I can take care of you.
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se, go bo@@ ther somebody else today.
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard Co@@ h@@ en@@ ."
And his whole work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still oft@@ en@@ times as dark as ever.
But the process, and the heav@@ y an@@ xi@@ ety around it was rele@@ as@@ ed when he took the gen@@ i@@ e, the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was ca@@ using nothing but trou@@ ble, and rele@@ as@@ ed it back where it came fr@@ om, and realized that this didn't have to be this inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ ed, tor@@ ment@@ ed thing.
It could be this pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar, won@@ d@@ rou@@ s, bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re collabor@@ ation, kind of conversation between To@@ m and the str@@ ang@@ e, ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om.
When I heard that story, it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I worked too, and this idea already sa@@ ved me on@@ c@@ e.
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the middle of writing "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, Lo@@ ve@@ ," and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disa@@ st@@ er, the worst book ever writt@@ en.
Not just ba@@ d, but the worst book ever writt@@ en.
And I started to think I should just dum@@ p this project.
But then I remem@@ ber@@ ed To@@ m talking to the open air and I tried it.
So I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and I direc@@ ted my com@@ ments to an emp@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room.
And I said al@@ ou@@ d, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilli@@ ant that is not enti@@ rely my fa@@ ul@@ t, right?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al.
But if you don't do that, you know what@@ , the h@@ ell with it.
I'm going to keep writing any@@ way because that's my job.
And I would please like the record to reflec@@ t today that I showed up for my part of the job@@ ." Because -- Because in the end it's like this, O@@ K -- cent@@ uri@@ es ago in the deser@@ ts of North Africa, people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ ances of sac@@ red dance and music that would go on for hours and hour@@ s, until da@@ w@@ n.
They were always mag@@ nific@@ ent, because the danc@@ ers were profes@@ sion@@ als and they were terri@@ fic@@ , right?
But every once in a while, very r@@ ar@@ ely, something would happen, and one of these perform@@ ers would actually become tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent.
And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all se@@ en, at some point in your life, a perform@@ ance like this.
It was like time would stop@@ , and the danc@@ er would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 ni@@ ghts before, but everything would al@@ ig@@ n.
And all of a sudd@@ en, he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely hum@@ an.
He would be li@@ t from wi@@ thin@@ , and li@@ t from below and all li@@ t up on fire with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity.
And when this happen@@ ed, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its nam@@ e.
They would put their hands together and they would start to chan@@ t, "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, God, God, God@@ ."
That's God, you know.
C@@ uri@@ ous histor@@ ical foot@@ no@@ te@@ : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ ad@@ ed sou@@ thern S@@ pain@@ , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ uri@@ es from "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h@@ ," to "O@@ l@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ ," which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o danc@@ es.
In S@@ pain@@ , when a perform@@ er has done something impossible and mag@@ ic, "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , Al@@ la@@ h, mag@@ nific@@ ent, bra@@ vo@@ ," in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble, there it is -- a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
Which is great@@ , because we need that.
But, the tr@@ ick@@ y bit comes the next morning, for the danc@@ er him@@ self, when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it's T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ ., and he's no longer a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
He's just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es, and maybe he's never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again.
And maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant God@@ 's name again as he sp@@ in@@ s, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life@@ ?
This is har@@ d.
This is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of angu@@ ish if you never happened to believ@@ e, in the first place, that the most extraordinary as@@ pec@@ ts of your being came from you.
But maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be passed along when you're finish@@ ed, with somebody else.
And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be publi@@ sh@@ ed, as the danger@@ ously, fri@@ ght@@ en@@ ingly over@@ -@@ an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ated follow up to my f@@ rea@@ k@@ ish succ@@ ess.
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psy@@ ched out about that is don't be af@@ rai@@ d.
Don't be da@@ un@@ ted. Just do your job.
Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.
If your job is to d@@ ance, do your d@@ ance.
If the di@@ v@@ ine, c@@ oc@@ ke@@ yed gen@@ i@@ us as@@ sig@@ ned to your case decid@@ es to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be g@@ lim@@ p@@ sed, for just one moment through your effor@@ ts, then "O@@ l@@ é@@ !"
And if not, do your dance any@@ how@@ .
And "O@@ l@@ é@@ !" to you, n@@ one@@ the@@ less.
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.
"O@@ l@@ é@@ !" to you, n@@ one@@ the@@ less, just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
J@@ une Co@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ é@@ !
You know, I've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean, and discover@@ ing new se@@ ts of gen@@ es.
We're actually starting at a new poin@@ t: we've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing bio@@ logy, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new pha@@ se of biology with designing and synthe@@ siz@@ ing life.
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.
"What is life@@ ?" is something that I think many bio@@ logists have been trying to understand at various level@@ s.
We've tried various approach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al compon@@ ents.
We've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing it now for almost 20 year@@ s;
when we sequ@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ om@@ e, it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer.
Now we're trying to as@@ k, "@@ Can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this digital univer@@ se@@ ?"
This is the map of a small organis@@ m, M@@ y@@ cop@@ l@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um, that has the smalle@@ st gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ replic@@ ate in the labor@@ ator@@ y,
and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller gen@@ om@@ e.
We're able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here.
When we look at its me@@ t@@ abo@@ lic ma@@ p, it's relati@@ vely simple compared to our@@ s --
tr@@ ust me, this is simple --
but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time, it's very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell@@ .
So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthe@@ size this ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some so we could v@@ ary the compon@@ ents to ask some of these most fundamental questions.
And so we started down the road of@@ : can we synthe@@ size a ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some@@ ?
Can chemistr@@ y per@@ mit making these really large molecu@@ les where we've never been before@@ ?
And if we do, can we boo@@ t up a ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some@@ ?
A ch@@ rom@@ o@@ som@@ e, by the way, is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical materi@@ al.
So, our p@@ ace of dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing life has been increas@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ ential pac@@ e.
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slow@@ ly but has been increas@@ ing,
and our lat@@ est point would put it on, now, an exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ve.
We started this over 15 years ago.
It took several st@@ ag@@ es, in fact, starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experim@@ ents.
But it turns out synthe@@ siz@@ ing DNA is very difficul@@ t.
There are t@@ ens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it's a de@@ gener@@ ate process, so the longer you make the piec@@ e, the more err@@ ors there are.
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for putting these little pieces together and correc@@ t all the err@@ ors.
And this was our first attem@@ p@@ t, starting with the digital information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 17@@ 4@@ .
It's a small virus that k@@ ills bacter@@ ia.
We designed the piec@@ es, went through our er@@ ror correc@@ tion and had a DNA molecu@@ le of about 5,000 let@@ ters.
The exciting pha@@ se came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacter@@ ia, and the bacteria started to read this genetic co@@ de, made the vir@@ al partic@@ les.
The vir@@ al particles then were rele@@ as@@ ed from the cells and came back and killed the E@@ . co@@ li@@ .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model@@ .
They la@@ ugh@@ ed more than you guys are.
And so, we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a biological system.
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger@@ :
we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some --
it's over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of genetic code --
so we thought we'd build them in cas@@ sett@@ es the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually v@@ ary the cas@@ sett@@ es to understand what the actual compon@@ ents of a living cell are.
Des@@ ign is crit@@ ical, and if you're starting with digital information in the compu@@ ter, that digital information has to be really acc@@ ur@@ ate.
When we first sequ@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 199@@ 5, the standard of acc@@ ur@@ acy was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pair@@ s.
We actually f@@ ound, on rese@@ qu@@ enc@@ ing it, 30 err@@ or@@ s; had we used that original sequ@@ ence, it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up.
P@@ art of the design is designing pieces that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 50@@ -@@ let@@ ter pieces to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together.
We design unique ele@@ ments into this.
You may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in.
Think of this: we have a four@@ -@@ let@@ ter genetic code -- A, C@@ , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ ple@@ ts of those let@@ ters code for rough@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s, such that there's a single let@@ ter design@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s.
So we can use the genetic code to write out words, sent@@ enc@@ es, thou@@ ght@@ s.
In@@ iti@@ ally, all we did was au@@ to@@ graph it.
Some people were disap@@ poin@@ ted there was not poe@@ tr@@ y.
We designed these pieces so we can just ch@@ ew back with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes@@ ;
there are en@@ z@@ ym@@ es that re@@ pair them and put them together.
And we started making piec@@ es, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters, put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,000@@ -@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es, then put se@@ ts of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000@@ .
At each st@@ age, we grew up these pieces in ab@@ un@@ dance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minut@@ e.
We're trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation.
So, this looks like a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball play@@ off.
When we get into these really large pieces over 100@@ ,000 base pair@@ s, they won't any longer grow rea@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i --
it ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sts all the modern tools of molec@@ ular biology --
and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms.
We knew there's a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ o@@ log@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair DNA that can put pieces together.
Here's an example of it@@ :
there's an organ@@ ism called De@@ in@@ oc@@ oc@@ c@@ us radi@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radi@@ ation.
You can see in the top pan@@ el, its ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some just gets blow@@ n a@@ part.
Tw@@ el@@ ve to 2@@ 4 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cat@@ ed@@ ;
they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um.
I am absolutely certain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space, move around, find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment@@ .
In fact, NAS@@ A has shown a lot of this is out there.
Here's an actual micro@@ graph of the molecu@@ le we built using these process@@ es, actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in@@ ;
ye@@ ast puts them together autom@@ at@@ ically.
This is not an electro@@ n micro@@ graph@@ ; this is just a reg@@ ular pho@@ tom@@ icro@@ graph@@ .
It's such a large molecu@@ le we can see it with a light micro@@ scop@@ e.
These are pictures over about a six@@ -@@ second perio@@ d.
So, this is the pub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a short while ago.
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of genetic co@@ de@@ ;
it's the largest molecu@@ le ever made by humans of a defin@@ ed structure.
It's over 300 million molec@@ ular we@@ i@@ ght.
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing, it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ages just to print this genetic co@@ de.
Well, how do we boo@@ t up a ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some@@ ? How do we activ@@ ate this?
Ob@@ vi@@ ously, with a virus it's pretty sim@@ ple@@ ;
it's much more complicated dealing with bacter@@ ia.
It's also sim@@ ple@@ r when you go into e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ yo@@ tes like our@@ sel@@ v@@ es: you can just po@@ p out the nucle@@ us and po@@ p in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing.
With bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a, the ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some is integr@@ ated into the c@@ ell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete trans@@ plant of a ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it.
We pu@@ ri@@ fied a ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species --
rough@@ ly, these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could selec@@ t for this ch@@ rom@@ o@@ som@@ e,
we di@@ ge@@ sted it with en@@ z@@ ym@@ es to kill all the prote@@ in@@ s,
and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreci@@ ate our very s@@ ophi@@ stic@@ ated graph@@ ics here. The new ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some went into the cell@@ .
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it w@@ ent, but we tried to design the process a little bit fur@@ ther.
This is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here.
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some or a third one from some@@ where, ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that speci@@ es.
So, people who think of evolution as just one gen@@ e changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of bio@@ logy.
There are en@@ z@@ ym@@ es called re@@ stric@@ tion en@@ z@@ ym@@ es that actually di@@ gest DN@@ A.
The ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some that was in the cell doesn't have one@@ ;
the ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some we put in do@@ es.
It got expres@@ sed and it recogn@@ ized the other ch@@ rom@@ o@@ some as fore@@ ign materi@@ al, ch@@ ew@@ ed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new ch@@ rom@@ o@@ som@@ e.
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.
And with a very short period of time, all the character@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell@@ .
All the prote@@ ins change@@ d, the mem@@ bran@@ es change@@ d@@ ; when we read the genetic co@@ de, it's exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in.
So, this may sound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dram@@ at@@ ically.
Now I've argu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is@@ ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution@@ . And I've argu@@ ed that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cam@@ bri@@ an explo@@ sion, where there's massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design.
Why do this?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the need@@ s.
We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years.
To put it in contex@@ t for my@@ self@@ : I was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ ; within 40 years, there@@ 'll be four@@ .
We have trouble feed@@ ing, provi@@ ding fre@@ sh, clean water, medic@@ in@@ es, fuel for the six and a half billi@@ on.
It's going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine.
We use over five billion tons of co@@ al, 30 billi@@ on-@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of oil --
that's a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day.
When we try to think of biological proc@@ esses or any process to re@@ place that, it's going to be a huge challeng@@ e.
Then of course, there's all that CO@@ 2 from this material that ends up in the atmosp@@ here.
We now, from our disc@@ o@@ very around the world, have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es, and I like to think of these as the design compon@@ ents of the future.
The electr@@ on@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so compon@@ ents, and look at the diversity that came out of that.
We're lim@@ ited here primar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagin@@ ation.
We now have techni@@ qu@@ es, because of these ra@@ pid me@@ tho@@ ds of synthe@@ si@@ s, to do what we're call@@ ing combin@@ ator@@ ial gen@@ om@@ ics.
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million ch@@ rom@@ o@@ som@@ es a day.
When you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different genes or trying to optim@@ ize proc@@ esses to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce ph@@ arm@@ ace@@ ut@@ ic@@ als, new vacc@@ in@@ es, we can just with a small te@@ am, do more molec@@ ular biology than the last 20 years of all science.
And it's just standard selec@@ tion@@ :
we can selec@@ t for vi@@ abil@@ ity, chemical or fuel produc@@ tion, vacc@@ ine produc@@ tion, etc.
This is a screen s@@ n@@ ap@@ shot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer.
You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like@@ :
we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.
We're foc@@ using on now four@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ el@@ s.
You've seen rec@@ ently, cor@@ n to e@@ than@@ o@@ l is just a bad experim@@ ent.
We have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relati@@ vely soon that are su@@ gar@@ , to much high@@ er-@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of but@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increas@@ ing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO@@ 2 as its feed@@ st@@ oc@@ k, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this ro@@ ad. And we think we'll have the first four@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 month@@ s.
Sun@@ light and CO@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ od ... but in our disc@@ o@@ very around the world, we have all kinds of other me@@ th@@ od@@ s.
This is an organ@@ ism we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6@@ .
It lives in the deep oce@@ an, about a m@@ ile and a half deep@@ , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water temper@@ ature@@ s.
It takes CO@@ 2 to me@@ than@@ e using molec@@ ular hydrogen as its energy sourc@@ e.
We're looking to see if we can take cap@@ ture@@ d CO@@ 2, which can easi@@ ly be pi@@ ped to sit@@ es, conver@@ t that CO@@ 2 back into fuel to drive this process.
So, in a short period of time, we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of "What is life@@ ?" We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have mo@@ dest go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l@@ -@@ chemical industry --
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED@@ , where can you@@ ? --
become a major source of energy ...
But also, we're now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant se@@ ts of vacc@@ in@@ es.
You've seen this year with flu@@ ; we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vacc@@ ine.
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ ator@@ ial vacc@@ ines in adv@@ ance.
Here's what the future may begin to look like with chang@@ ing, now, the evolutionary tre@@ e, spe@@ ed@@ ing up evolution with synthe@@ tic bacter@@ ia, Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and, event@@ u@@ ally, e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ yo@@ t@@ es.
We're a ways away from impro@@ ving people@@ :
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.
What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some found@@ ational work, some new technology that we brought to Micro@@ soft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ is@@ ition almost exactly a year ago. This is Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on, and it's an environment
in which you can either loc@@ ally or remo@@ tely interact with v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of visual data.
We're looking at many, many g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of digital photo@@ s here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in, pan@@ ning through it, re@@ arr@@ ang@@ ing it in any way we want.
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are.
Most of them are ordinary digital camera photo@@ s, but this one, for example, is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gres@@ s, and it's in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el r@@ ang@@ e.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the perform@@ ance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment. It's also very fle@@ xi@@ ble architec@@ ture.
This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-@@ image data.
This is "@@ B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ en@@ s. Every col@@ um@@ n is a cha@@ p@@ ter.
To pro@@ ve to you that it's really tex@@ t, and not an imag@@ e, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real represent@@ ation of the t@@ ext@@ ; it's not a picture.
Maybe this is an arti@@ ficial way to read an e-@@ book.
I wouldn't re@@ comm@@ end it.
This is a more real@@ istic case, an issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
Every large image is the beginning of a sec@@ tion.
And this really gives you the jo@@ y and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magaz@@ ine or a newsp@@ a@@ per@@ , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ um.
We've done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
We've made up a fa@@ ke ad that's very high re@@ solution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we've em@@ be@@ d@@ ded extra cont@@ ent.
If you want to see the feature@@ s of this car, you can see it here.
Or other model@@ s, or even techn@@ ical speci@@ fic@@ ations.
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on screen real est@@ ate.
We hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ up@@ s and other r@@ ub@@ b@@ ish like that -- shouldn't be necess@@ ary.
Of course, ma@@ pping is one of those obvious applic@@ ations for a technology like this.
And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribut@@ e to this field as well.
But those are all the road@@ s in the U.S. super@@ im@@ posed on top of a NAS@@ A ge@@ o@@ sp@@ ati@@ al imag@@ e.
So let's pull up, now, something else.
This is actually live on the We@@ b now@@ ; you can go check it out.
This is a project called P@@ ho@@ to@@ syn@@ th, which marri@@ es two different technologi@@ es.
One of them is Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful compu@@ ter-@@ vision research done by No@@ a@@ h S@@ na@@ vel@@ y, a gradu@@ ate student at the University of Washing@@ t@@ on, co@@ -@@ ad@@ vi@@ sed by Ste@@ ve Se@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W@@ . and R@@ ick S@@ z@@ e@@ li@@ sk@@ i at Micro@@ soft Res@@ ear@@ ch. A very nice collabor@@ ation.
And so this is live on the We@@ b. It's power@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on.
You can see that when we do these sorts of view@@ s, where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi@@ -@@ re@@ solution experience.
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the images here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful.
The computer vision al@@ gori@@ th@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real space in which these sho@@ ts -- all taken near Gr@@ ass@@ i La@@ kes in the Can@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ ock@@ ies -- all these sho@@ ts were ta@@ k@@ en. So you see ele@@ ments here of st@@ ab@@ i@@ liz@@ ed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been related sp@@ ati@@ ally.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environment@@ s.
Some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al.
I would like to jum@@ p straight to one of No@@ ah@@ 's original dat@@ a-@@ se@@ ts -- this is from an early proto@@ type that we first got working this summ@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ unch line behind the P@@ ho@@ to@@ syn@@ th technology, It's not necessarily so app@@ ar@@ ent from looking at the environment@@ s we've put up on the websit@@ e.
We had to worry about the law@@ y@@ ers and so on.
This is a re@@ construc@@ tion of No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done enti@@ rely comput@@ ation@@ ally from images sc@@ ra@@ ped from F@@ l@@ ick@@ r. You just type No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ l@@ ick@@ r@@ , and you get some pictures of guys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts, and of the cam@@ p@@ us and so on. And each of these or@@ ange con@@ es re@@ presents an image that was discovered to be@@ long to this model@@ .
And so these are all F@@ l@@ ick@@ r imag@@ es, and they've all been related sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way.
We can just na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate in this very simple way.
You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Micro@@ sof@@ t.
It's very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here.
I guess you can see this is lots of different types of camer@@ as@@ : it's everything from cell@@ -@@ phone camer@@ as to profes@@ sional S@@ L@@ R@@ s, quite a large number of them, stit@@ ched together in this environment@@ .
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ird ones --
So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by fac@@ es, and so on.
Some@@ where in here there is actually a series of photograph@@ s -- here we go.
This is actually a po@@ ster of No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed correc@@ t@@ ly.
We can di@@ ve in from the po@@ ster to a physical view of this environment@@ .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment@@ . This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive memor@@ y, visu@@ ally, of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together.
Those photo@@ s become lin@@ ked, and they make something emerg@@ ent that's greater than the sum of the par@@ ts.
You have a model that emerg@@ es of the entire Earth.
Think of this as the long tail to Ste@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ l@@ er's Vir@@ tual Earth work.
And this is something that grow@@ s in complex@@ ity as people use it, and whose benef@@ its become greater to the us@@ ers as they use it.
The@@ ir own photo@@ s are getting t@@ ag@@ ged with meta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed.
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are, then my pho@@ to of No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ ric@@ hed with all of that data, and I can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space, into that meta@@ -@@ ver@@ se, using everybody else@@ 's photo@@ s, and do a kind of a cro@@ ss@@ -@@ mo@@ d@@ al and cro@@ ss@@ -@@ use@@ r social experience that way.
And of course, a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satell@@ ite images and so on, but from the collec@@ tive memor@@ y.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right? What your software is going to allow@@ , is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shar@@ ed by anyone across the world are going to lin@@ k toge@@ ther@@ ?
B@@ A@@ A: Y@@ es. What this is really doing is discover@@ ing,
creating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks, if you will@@ , between imag@@ es.
It's doing that based on the content inside the imag@@ es.
And that gets really exciting when you think about the ric@@ h@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information a lot of images have.
Like when you do a web search for imag@@ es, you type in ph@@ r@@ as@@ es, and the tex@@ t on the web page is car@@ rying a lot of information about what that picture is of.
What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your picture@@ s?
The amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connec@@ tion and ric@@ h@@ ness that comes out of that is really hu@@ ge.
It's a clas@@ si@@ c network effec@@ t.
CA: T@@ ru@@ ly incredi@@ ble. Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations.
You know, one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ure@@ s of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ic research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the win@@ d, touch it in st@@ ones po@@ li@@ shed by ra@@ in, ta@@ ste it in the bit@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts.
Just to know that J@@ agu@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still journey beyond the Mil@@ ky W@@ a@@ y, or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with mean@@ ing, or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a, the Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts still pursu@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma@@ , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthro@@ po@@ logy, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absol@@ ute sense, but is just one model of real@@ ity,
the consequ@@ ence of one particular set of adap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age ma@@ de, al@@ be@@ it success@@ ful@@ ly, many gener@@ ations ago.
And of course, we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves.
We're all bor@@ n. We all bring our children into the world.
We go through initi@@ ation r@@ it@@ es.
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of dea@@ th, so it shouldn't surpri@@ se us that we all s@@ ing, we all d@@ ance,
we all have ar@@ t.
But what's interesting is the unique ca@@ d@@ ence of the song@@ , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dance in every cul@@ ture.
And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the fore@@ sts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o, or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ iti@@ , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut deser@@ t of Nor@@ thern Keny@@ a, the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the moun@@ tains of the An@@ d@@ es, or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the Sa@@ har@@ a --
this is inc@@ ident@@ ally the fel@@ low that I travel@@ ed into the deser@@ t with a month ago -- or inde@@ ed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma@@ , Ever@@ est@@ , the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mother of the world.
All of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of be@@ ing, other ways of thinking, other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing yourself in the Earth.
And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only f@@ ill you with hop@@ e.
Now, together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a web of spir@@ it@@ ual life and cultural life that en@@ velo@@ ps the planet, and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as inde@@ ed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sp@@ here.
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, and you might def@@ ine the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thou@@ ghts and dream@@ s, my@@ th@@ s, ideas, inspir@@ ations, intu@@ iti@@ ons brought into being by the human imagin@@ ation since the da@@ w@@ n of conscious@@ ness.
The eth@@ no@@ sphere is human@@ it@@ y's great leg@@ ac@@ y.
It's the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive speci@@ es.
And just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded, so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and, if any@@ thing, at a far greater r@@ ate.
No bio@@ logi@@ sts, for example, would d@@ are sug@@ gest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinc@@ tion because it simply is not tru@@ e, and yet that -- the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- scar@@ c@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most optim@@ istic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultural di@@ vers@@ ity.
And the great indic@@ ator of that, of course, is language los@@ s.
When each of you in this room were bor@@ n, there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ ken on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mat@@ ical ru@@ les.
A language is a fl@@ ash of the human spir@@ it.
It's a vehic@@ le through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world.
Every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind, a water@@ sh@@ ed, a thought, an eco@@ system of spir@@ it@@ ual possibil@@ ities.
And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ag@@ es, as we sit here today in Mon@@ ter@@ e@@ y, fully half are no longer being whi@@ sp@@ ered into the ear@@ s of children.
They're no longer being taught to bab@@ ies, which mean@@ s, effec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, un@@ less something chang@@ es, they're already dea@@ d.
What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ velo@@ ped in sil@@ ence, to be the last of your people to speak your langu@@ age, to have no way to pass on the wis@@ dom of the ancest@@ ors or an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ate the prom@@ ise of the childr@@ en@@ ?
And yet, that d@@ read@@ ful f@@ ate is inde@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on Earth rough@@ ly every two wee@@ ks, because every two wee@@ ks, some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ lab@@ les of an ancient ton@@ gu@@ e.
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better,
wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one langu@@ age@@ ?" And I say, "@@ Gre@@ at, let's make that language Yor@@ ub@@ a. Let's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ es@@ e.
Let's make it K@@ o@@ gi@@ ."
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own langu@@ age.
And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here,
a bri@@ ef journey through the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lo@@ st.
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "@@ different ways of be@@ ing@@ ," I really do mean different ways of be@@ ing.
Ta@@ ke, for example, this child of a Bar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ d@@ a who believe that my@@ tho@@ log@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red s@@ n@@ ak@@ es.
Now, this is a people who cogn@@ iti@@ vely do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ ven@@ s is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people dep@@ end.
They have a curi@@ ous language and marri@@ age rule which is called "@@ l@@ ing@@ u@@ istic ex@@ o@@ gam@@ y@@ :@@ " you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different langu@@ age.
And this is all roo@@ ted in the my@@ tho@@ logical pa@@ st, yet the curi@@ ous thing is in these long hous@@ es, where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marri@@ age, you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a langu@@ age.
They simply listen and then begin to spea@@ k.
Or@@ , one of the most fascin@@ ating tri@@ bes I ever lived with, the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ aster@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or, an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8@@ .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7, five mis@@ sion@@ aries attem@@ p@@ ted cont@@ act and made a critical mista@@ ke.
They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ s@@ y photograph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly ge@@ stu@@ re@@ s, for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives.
They picked up these photograph@@ s from the forest flo@@ or, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure@@ , found no@@ thing, and conc@@ lu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the dev@@ il, so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to dea@@ th.
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn't just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ der@@ s.
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other.
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ aring each other.
We trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations, and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ low@@ s had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him any@@ way. But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing.
The@@ ir hun@@ ters could sm@@ ell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it beh@@ in@@ d.
In the early '@@ 8@@ 0s, I had a really ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at Har@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to Ha@@ iti@@ , inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the secre@@ t socie@@ ties which were the found@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er's streng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ out@@ es, and secur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.
In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable fa@@ ith of V@@ od@@ oun@@ . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t.
On the contr@@ ary, it's a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view@@ .
It's interesting.
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world, what would you sa@@ y?
Chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity, Is@@ l@@ am, Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ism, Ju@@ da@@ ism, what@@ ever.
There's always one contin@@ ent left out, the assum@@ ption being that sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa had no religious beli@@ ef@@ s. Well, of course, they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religious ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very er@@ a.
But, what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dea@@ d.
So, the living give birth to the spir@@ its.
The spir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from bene@@ ath the Great Wat@@ er, respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dance to mom@@ ent@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the li@@ ving, so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ ining moment, the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the go@@ d.
That's why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that "You white people go to chur@@ ch and speak about Go@@ d.
We dance in the tem@@ ple and become God@@ ."
And because you are pos@@ ses@@ sed, you are taken by the spir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ med@@ ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing demonstr@@ ation@@ s: V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ un@@ ity, a rather ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing demonstr@@ ation of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the state of extre@@ me excit@@ ation.
Now, of all the peop@@ les that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the K@@ o@@ g@@ i of the Si@@ err@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ thern Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a.
Des@@ c@@ end@@ ants of the ancient T@@ air@@ on@@ a civiliz@@ ation which once car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al plain of Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a, in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ quest@@ , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars above the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain@@ .
In a bloo@@ d@@ stain@@ ed contin@@ ent, these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ pan@@ ish@@ .
To this day, they re@@ main r@@ ul@@ ed by a r@@ it@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the training for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extra@@ ordin@@ ary.
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four@@ , se@@ quest@@ ered in a sha@@ d@@ ow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 year@@ s:
two n@@ ine@@ -@@ year perio@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ se@@ n to m@@ im@@ ic the nine months of ge@@ st@@ ation they spend in their natural mo@@ ther@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ; now they are metaph@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mo@@ ther.
And for this entire time, they are inc@@ ul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their societ@@ y, values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers alone main@@ tain the co@@ sm@@ ic -- or we might say the eco@@ logical -- bal@@ ance.
And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18@@ , they see a sun@@ ri@@ se. And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of awar@@ en@@ ess of first light as the Su@@ n beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscap@@ e, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstr@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ or@@ y. And the pri@@ est ste@@ ps back
and says, "You see@@ ? It's really as I've told you.
It is that beauti@@ ful. It is your@@ s to protec@@ t."
They call themselves the "@@ el@@ der bro@@ ther@@ s" and they say w@@ e, who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ ther@@ s, are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world.
Now, this level of intu@@ ition becomes very important.
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and landscap@@ e, we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the "@@ no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age@@ ," which is an idea rac@@ ist in its sim@@ plic@@ ity, or altern@@ ati@@ vel@@ y, we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ a@@ u and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
Well, in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sen@@ tim@@ ental no@@ r we@@ ak@@ ened by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a.
There's not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ar@@ ial sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ illing win@@ ds of Ti@@ be@@ t, but they have, ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less, through time and r@@ itu@@ al, for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it, but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intu@@ iti@@ on@@ : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is brea@@ the@@ d into being by human conscious@@ ness.
Now, what does that mean@@ ?
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who's rais@@ ed to believe that that mountain is an A@@ p@@ u spir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her de@@ stin@@ y will be a prof@@ ound@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that res@@ ource or that place than a young kid from Mon@@ tan@@ a rais@@ ed to believe that a mountain is a p@@ ile of rock ready to be min@@ ed.
Wh@@ e@@ ther it's the abo@@ de of a spir@@ it or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ relev@@ ant.
What's interesting is the metaph@@ or that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
I was rais@@ ed in the fore@@ sts of Brit@@ ish Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those fore@@ sts exist@@ ed to be cu@@ t.
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the abo@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ roo@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ well@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world, spir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a initi@@ ation.
Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ ities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discover@@ ies. Take this plant here.
It's a photograph I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pr@@ il.
This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca@@ , which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man@@ 's re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re.
What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a fascin@@ ating is not the she@@ er ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ o@@ logical potential of this prepar@@ ation, but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different sourc@@ es:
on the one hand, this woo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ in@@ es, har@@ min@@ e, har@@ mal@@ ine, m@@ ild@@ ly hall@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ z@@ y smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your conscious@@ ness -- but it's mix@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family called P@@ sy@@ cho@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ di@@ s.
This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ es, very close to brain ser@@ o@@ ton@@ in, di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine, 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine.
If you've ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blow@@ ing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ s@@ es, that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine.
To have that pow@@ der blow@@ n up your no@@ se is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and l@@ anding on a sea of electric@@ ity. It doesn't create the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ it@@ y; it creates the dis@@ solution of real@@ ity.
In fact, I used to argu@@ e with my profes@@ sor@@ , Richard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c er@@ a with his disc@@ o@@ very of the magic mus@@ h@@ room@@ s in Mexic@@ o in the 19@@ 30@@ s --
I used to argu@@ e that you couldn't clas@@ si@@ fy these tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ines as hall@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you're under the effec@@ ts there's no one home any@@ more to experience a hall@@ uc@@ in@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they're den@@ ature@@ d by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ da@@ se.
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chemical that den@@ ature@@ s the M@@ A@@ O@@ .
Now, the fascin@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the preci@@ se sort necess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine. So you ask yourself a question. H@@ ow, in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 species of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar plan@@ ts, do these people find these two mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ically un@@ related plants that when comb@@ ined in this way, created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the part@@ s?
Well, we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism, "@@ tri@@ al and err@@ or@@ ," which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ less.
But you ask the Indi@@ ans, and they say, "The plants talk to us@@ ."
Well, what does that mean@@ ?
This tri@@ be, the C@@ of@@ an, has 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca@@ , all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the fore@@ st, all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one speci@@ es.
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ onom@@ y and they say, "I thought you knew something about plan@@ ts. I mean, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "@@ No@@ ."
Well, it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties in the night of a full mo@@ on, and it s@@ ings to you in a different ke@@ y.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D. at Har@@ v@@ ar@@ d, but it's a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ en@@ s.
Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but somehow reduc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world, meaning our world, mo@@ ves on.
Well, the truth is the 20@@ th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technolog@@ ical innov@@ ations, but rather as the er@@ a in which we st@@ ood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruc@@ tion of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.
All cul@@ tures through all time have const@@ antly been eng@@ aged in a dance with new possibil@@ ities of life.
And the problem is not technology itself.
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y.
It's not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here. It is power,
the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation.
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cul@@ tures de@@ st@@ ined to f@@ ade a@@ wa@@ y;
these are dynam@@ ic living peop@@ les being driven out of exist@@ ence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adap@@ t to@@ :
whether it's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an --
a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast Asi@@ a, from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ stit@@ ution on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s, where you can see the ri@@ ver itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seems to be car@@ rying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the South China Se@@ a, where the Japan@@ ese fre@@ igh@@ ters han@@ g light in the hor@@ iz@@ on
ready to f@@ ill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w log@@ s ri@@ pped from the forest --
or, in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami@@ , it's the disease ent@@ ities that have come in, in the wa@@ ke of the disc@@ o@@ very of gol@@ d.
Or if we go into the moun@@ tains of Ti@@ be@@ t, where I'm doing a lot of research rec@@ ently, you'll see it's a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation.
You know, gen@@ oc@@ id@@ e, the physical extinc@@ tion of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ne@@ d, but eth@@ no@@ c@@ id@@ e, the destruc@@ tion of people's way of life, is not only not con@@ dem@@ ne@@ d, it's univers@@ ally, in many quar@@ ters, celebr@@ ated as part of a development strateg@@ y.
And you cannot understand the pain of Ti@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the ground level.
I once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ aster@@ n Ti@@ be@@ t to L@@ has@@ a with a young colleagu@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ has@@ a that I understood the face behind the statist@@ ics you hear about@@ :
6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n a@@ part to d@@ ust and ash@@ es,
1.@@ 2 million people killed by the ca@@ dre@@ s during the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evolution@@ .
This young man@@ 's father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a.
That meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the Chinese inv@@ as@@ i@@ on.
His un@@ cle fl@@ ed with His H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al.
His mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being weal@@ th@@ y.
He was sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t tail@@ s because she couldn't be@@ ar to be without him.
The si@@ ster who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education cam@@ p.
One day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gres@@ sion, she was given seven years of hard lab@@ or.
The pain of Ti@@ be@@ t can be impossible to be@@ ar, but the re@@ dem@@ p@@ tive spir@@ it of the people is something to be@@ hol@@ d.
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a cho@@ ic@@ e:
do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ rom@@ atic world of mon@@ o@@ ton@@ y or do we want to embr@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ rom@@ atic world of di@@ vers@@ it@@ y?
Mar@@ gar@@ et M@@ ea@@ d, the great anthro@@ po@@ logi@@ st, said, before she di@@ ed, that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagin@@ ation reduc@@ ed to a more nar@@ row mo@@ d@@ ality of thought, but that we would wa@@ ke from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibil@@ ities.
And it's hum@@ bl@@ ing to remember that our species ha@@ s, perha@@ ps, been around for [@@ 1@@ 50@@ ,000@@ ] years.
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolution -- which gave us agricul@@ ture, at which time we succ@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed@@ ; the poe@@ try of the sha@@ man was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d@@ ; we created hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world as we know it is b@@ are@@ ly 300 years old.
Now, that sh@@ allow history doesn't sug@@ gest to me that we have all the answ@@ ers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a.
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the meaning of being hum@@ an, they respon@@ d with 10,000 different vo@@ ices.
And it's within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are@@ : a fully consci@@ ous speci@@ es, fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ d@@ ens find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh. And there are great mom@@ ents of optim@@ ism.
This is a photograph I took at the nor@@ thern ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Is@@ land when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people, and this man, O@@ lay@@ u@@ k, told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ fa@@ ther.
The Can@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people, and during the 19@@ 50@@ s, to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh our s@@ over@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty, we forc@@ ed them into sett@@ le@@ ments.
This old man@@ 's grand@@ father ref@@ used to go.
The famil@@ y, f@@ ear@@ ful for his life, took away all of his weap@@ ons, all of his tool@@ s.
Now, you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fear the col@@ d@@ ; they took adv@@ ant@@ age of it.
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish w@@ ra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de.
So, this man@@ 's grand@@ father was not in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the b@@ liz@@ z@@ ard that was blow@@ ing.
He simply sli@@ pped out@@ side, pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and def@@ ec@@ ated into his hand. And as the f@@ ec@@ es began to free@@ z@@ e, he sha@@ ped it into the form of a bl@@ ad@@ e.
He put a sp@@ ray of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d, he but@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it.
He sk@@ in@@ ned the dog and im@@ provi@@ sed a har@@ ness, took the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the dog and im@@ provi@@ sed a sle@@ d, har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g, and disappear@@ ed over the ice flo@@ es, sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t.
Talk about getting by with no@@ thing. And this, in many ways -- -- is a sym@@ bo@@ l of the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people around the world.
The Can@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than Californi@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put together.
It's our new hom@@ el@@ and. It's called N@@ un@@ av@@ u@@ t.
It's an independ@@ ent terr@@ itor@@ y. They control all min@@ eral resourc@@ es.
An amazing example of how a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state can see@@ k re@@ stit@@ ution with its people.
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who@@ 've travel@@ ed in these remo@@ te reach@@ es of the planet, to realize that they're not remo@@ te at all.
They're hom@@ el@@ ands of some@@ body.
They re@@ present bran@@ ches of the human imagin@@ ation that go back to the da@@ w@@ n of time. And for all of us, the dream@@ s of these children, like the dream@@ s of our own children, become part of the na@@ ked ge@@ ograph@@ y of hop@@ e.
So, what we're trying to do at the National Ge@@ ograph@@ ic, finally, is, we believe that polit@@ icians will never ac@@ compli@@ sh anything.
We think that po@@ lem@@ ics --
-- we think that po@@ lem@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve, but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world, and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling instit@@ ution in the world. We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our web@@ site every mon@@ th.
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations carry our television chan@@ n@@ el.
Our magaz@@ ines are read by milli@@ ons.
And what we're doing is a series of journe@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have se@@ en, and hope@@ ful@@ ly, there@@ fore@@ , embr@@ ace gradu@@ ally, one by one, the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthro@@ po@@ log@@ y: that this world deser@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a diver@@ se way, that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al, pl@@ ur@@ alist@@ ic world
where all of the wis@@ dom of all peop@@ les can contribut@@ e to our collec@@ tive well-@@ be@@ ing.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you've already hear@@ d, and I'll try to make some connec@@ tions myself, in case you mis@@ sed them.
But I want to start with what I call the "@@ off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma@@ ."
The off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma of what?
The off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma of all Western industrial socie@@ ti@@ es. And the off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma run@@ s like this: if we are interested in ma@@ xim@@ iz@@ ing the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of our citiz@@ en@@ s, the way to do that is to ma@@ xim@@ ize individual fre@@ ed@@ om.
The reason for this is both that free@@ dom is in and of itself good, valu@@ able, wor@@ th@@ while, ess@@ ential to being hum@@ an.
And because if people have fre@@ ed@@ om, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xim@@ ize our w@@ el@@ far@@ e, and no one has to decide on our be@@ half@@ .
The way to ma@@ xim@@ ize free@@ dom is to ma@@ xim@@ ize cho@@ ice.
The more choice people have, the more free@@ dom they have, and the more free@@ dom they have, the more w@@ el@@ f@@ are they have.
Th@@ is, I think, is so deep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn't oc@@ cu@@ r to anyone to question it.
And it's also deep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us.
This is my super@@ market. Not such a big one.
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ing.
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ marke@@ t, if you don't coun@@ t the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dres@@ sing@@ s, in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on off@@ er su@@ it you.
So this is what the super@@ market is like.
And then you go to the consum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ics store to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spea@@ k@@ ers, C@@ D play@@ er, ta@@ pe play@@ er, tun@@ er, amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er --
and in this one single consum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ics store@@ , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o system@@ s.
We can construc@@ t six@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half@@ -@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the compon@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one store@@ .
You've got to ad@@ mit that's a lot of cho@@ ice.
In other dom@@ ain@@ s -- the world of communic@@ ations.
There was a time, when I was a bo@@ y, when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wan@@ ted, as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell@@ .
You r@@ ented your ph@@ one. You didn't buy it.
One consequ@@ ence of that, by the way, is that the phone never bro@@ ke.
And those days are g@@ one.
We now have an almost un@@ lim@@ ited vari@@ ety of ph@@ ones, especially in the world of cell ph@@ ones.
These are cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er, no@@ se ha@@ ir tri@@ m@@ m@@ er, and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch.
And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on, you will@@ .
And what this does is it leads people to walk into their store@@ s asking this question. And do you know what the answer to this question now is@@ ? The answer is "@@ no@@ ."
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
So, in other as@@ pec@@ ts of life that are much more significant than bu@@ ying things, the same explo@@ sion of choice is true.
He@@ al@@ th car@@ e. It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doc@@ tor, and the doc@@ tor tells you what to do.
Inste@@ ad, you go to the doc@@ tor, and the doc@@ tor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B@@ . A has these benef@@ it@@ s, and these ri@@ sk@@ s. B has these benef@@ it@@ s, and these ri@@ sk@@ s. What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ D@@ oc@@ , what should I do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c says, "@@ A has these benef@@ its and ri@@ sk@@ s, and B has these benef@@ its and ri@@ sk@@ s.
What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "If you were me, D@@ oc@@ , what would you do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c says, "@@ But I'm not you@@ ."
And the result is -- we call it "@@ patient aut@@ onom@@ y@@ ," which makes it sound like a good thing,
but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsi@@ bility for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely, the doc@@ tor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly s@@ ick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making deci@@ sions -- nam@@ ely, the pati@@ ent.
There's enormous marke@@ ting of pre@@ scri@@ ption dru@@ gs to people like you and me, which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them.
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them@@ ?
The answer is that they expect us to call our doc@@ tors the next morning and ask for our pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tions to be change@@ d.
Some@@ thing as dram@@ atic as our ident@@ ity has now become a matter of cho@@ ice, as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate. We don't in@@ her@@ it an ident@@ it@@ y; we get to inv@@ ent it.
And we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like.
And that means that every day, when you wa@@ ke up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
With respec@@ t to marri@@ age and famil@@ y, there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t assum@@ ption that almost everyone had is that you got mar@@ ried as soon as you c@@ oul@@ d, and then you started having kids as soon as you c@@ oul@@ d.
The only real choice was wh@@ o, not wh@@ en, and not what you did af@@ ter.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys, everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s.
I teach wonder@@ fully intelligent stud@@ ents, and I as@@ sign 20 percent less work than I used to.
And it's not because they're less smar@@ t, and it's not because they're less di@@ lig@@ ent.
It's because they are pre@@ oc@@ cup@@ i@@ ed, asking them@@ selves, "@@ Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried or no@@ t? Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried now@@ ?
Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried lat@@ er@@ ? Sh@@ ould I have kids first, or a care@@ er fir@@ st@@ ?"
All of these are consum@@ ing questions.
And they're going to answer these questi@@ ons, whether or not it means not doing all the work I as@@ sign and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es.
And inde@@ ed they shoul@@ d. These are important questions to answ@@ er.
Wor@@ k -- we are ble@@ s@@ sed, as Car@@ l was poin@@ ting out, with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph H@@ o@@ t@@ el.
There is one cor@@ n@@ er, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually works.
I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
So what this mean@@ s, this incredible free@@ dom of choice we have with respec@@ t to work, is that we have to make a deci@@ sion, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be work@@ ing.
We can go to watch our kid play soc@@ c@@ er, and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p, and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p, and our laptop@@ , pres@@ um@@ ab@@ ly, on our lap@@ s.
And even if they're all sh@@ ut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a soc@@ c@@ er gam@@ e, we are also asking our@@ selves, "@@ Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call@@ ?
Sh@@ ould I respon@@ d to this ema@@ il@@ ? Sh@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter@@ ?"
And even if the answer to the question is "@@ no@@ ," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid@@ 's soc@@ c@@ er game very different than it w@@ oul@@ d@@ 've be@@ en.
So every@@ where we loo@@ k, big things and small things, material things and lif@@ est@@ y@@ le things, life is a matter of cho@@ ice.
And the world we used to live in looked like this. [@@ Well, actually, they are written in st@@ one@@ .@@ ] That is to say, there were some cho@@ ices, but not everything was a matter of cho@@ ice.
And the world we now live in looks like this. [@@ The T@@ en Com@@ m@@ and@@ ments D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it@@ ] And the question is, is this good new@@ s, or bad new@@ s?
And the answer is, "@@ y@@ es."
We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
All of this choice has two effec@@ ts, two neg@@ ative effec@@ ts on people.
One effec@@ t, para@@ do@@ x@@ ically, is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s, rather than liber@@ ation.
With so many op@@ tions to choose fr@@ om, people find it very difficult to choose at all.
I'll give you one very dram@@ atic example of this: a study that was done of invest@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment plan@@ s.
A colle@@ ag@@ ue of mine got access to invest@@ ment recor@@ ds from V@@ angu@@ ar@@ d, the g@@ ig@@ antic mu@@ tu@@ al@@ -@@ fu@@ nd company of about a million employe@@ es and about 2,000 different work@@ places.
And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emplo@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed, rate of particip@@ ation went down two percent.
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ w@@ er employe@@ es particip@@ ate than if you only off@@ er fi@@ ve. Why?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose fr@@ om, it's so dam@@ n hard to decide which fu@@ nd to choo@@ se, that you'll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ row@@ .
And then tom@@ or@@ row@@ , and tom@@ or@@ row@@ , and tom@@ or@@ row@@ , and of course tom@@ or@@ row never com@@ es.
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the deci@@ sion is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ y@@ er.
By not partic@@ i@@ pat@@ ing, they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ y@@ er, who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion.
So par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is a consequ@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ices.
And I think it makes the world look like this.
[@@ And la@@ st@@ ly, for all e@@ tern@@ ity, Fr@@ en@@ ch, ble@@ u che@@ es@@ e, or ran@@ ch@@ ?@@ ]
You really want to get the deci@@ sion right if it's for all e@@ tern@@ ity, right?
You don't want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fun@@ d, or the wrong sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ing.
So that's one effec@@ t. The second effect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and make a cho@@ ice, we end up less s@@ ati@@ s@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fe@@ w@@ er op@@ tions to choose fr@@ om.
And there are several reasons for this.
One of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings to choose fr@@ om, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and what sal@@ ad dres@@ sing is@@ ? -- it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imag@@ ined altern@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de, and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ trac@@ ts from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de,
even if it was a good deci@@ sion.
The more op@@ tions there are, the easier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is disap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you cho@@ se.
Sec@@ on@@ d, what econom@@ ists call "@@ opportunity co@@ st@@ s."
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things dep@@ ends on what we comp@@ are them to.
Well, when there are lots of altern@@ ati@@ ves to consi@@ der, it is easy to imagine the at@@ trac@@ tive feature@@ s of altern@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ jec@@ t that make you less s@@ ati@@ s@@ fied with the altern@@ ative that you've cho@@ sen@@ .
Here's an example. [@@ I can't stop thinking about those other available par@@ king spac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et@@ ] S@@ or@@ ry if you're not New Yor@@ k@@ ers.
Here's what you're supposed to be thin@@ king.
Here's this couple on the H@@ am@@ pt@@ ons.
Very expensive real est@@ ate.
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach@@ . Be@@ auti@@ ful day. They have it all to themselves.
What could be bet@@ ter@@ ? "Well, dam@@ n it@@ ," this guy is thinking,
"@@ It's Au@@ gu@@ st. Everybody in my Man@@ h@@ att@@ an neighbor@@ hood is away.
I could be par@@ king right in front of my build@@ ing."
And he sp@@ ends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the opportun@@ ity, day after day, to have a great par@@ king space.
O@@ pp@@ or@@ tun@@ ity costs sub@@ tr@@ act from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choo@@ se, even when what we choose is terri@@ fic@@ .
And the more op@@ tions there are to consi@@ der, the more at@@ trac@@ tive feature@@ s of these op@@ tions are going to be reflec@@ ted by us as opportunity co@@ sts.
Here's another example.
Now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of poin@@ ts.
It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slow@@ ly.
But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you're choo@@ sing one thing, you're choo@@ sing not to do other things
that may have lots of at@@ trac@@ tive feature@@ s, and it's going to make what you're doing less at@@ trac@@ tive.
Th@@ ir@@ d: es@@ cal@@ ation of expect@@ ations.
This hit me when I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans.
I we@@ ar j@@ e@@ ans almost all the time.
There was a time when j@@ e@@ ans came in one fla@@ v@@ or, and you bought them, and they fit like cra@@ p, they were incredibly un@@ comfor@@ t@@ able, if you wor@@ e them and was@@ hed them enough times, they started to feel OK.
I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans after years of we@@ aring these old ones, and I said, "I want a pair of j@@ e@@ ans. Here's my siz@@ e."
And the shop@@ keep@@ er said, "@@ Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it, easy f@@ it, re@@ la@@ x@@ ed f@@ it?
You want but@@ ton fly or z@@ i@@ pper fl@@ y? You want st@@ on@@ ew@@ ash@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ he@@ d?
Do you want them dist@@ res@@ se@@ d?
You want boo@@ t cu@@ t, ta@@ per@@ ed, b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h@@ ." On and on he w@@ ent.
My j@@ a@@ w dro@@ p@@ pe@@ d. And after I re@@ cover@@ ed, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kin@@ d." He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n j@@ e@@ ans, and I walked out of the store -- tru@@ th@@ ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ f@@ itting j@@ e@@ ans I had ever ha@@ d.
I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better.
But -- I felt wor@@ se.
Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to my@@ self.
The reason -- The reason I felt wor@@ se is that, with all of these op@@ tions avail@@ able, my expect@@ ations about how good a pair of j@@ e@@ ans should be went up.
I had very low@@ , no particular expect@@ ations when they only came in one fla@@ v@@ or. When they came in 100 fla@@ v@@ ors, dam@@ n it, one of them shoul@@ d@@ 've been perfec@@ t.
And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfec@@ t.
And so I compared what I got to what I expec@@ ted, and what I got was disap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ is@@ on to what I expec@@ ted.
Ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people's lives can't help but increase the expect@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be.
And what that's going to produce is less s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion with resul@@ ts, even when they're good resul@@ ts.
No@@ body in the world of marke@@ ting knows this.
[@@ It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disap@@ poin@@ te@@ d@@ .@@ ] Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.
The truth is more like this.
[@@ Everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se@@ ] The reason that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se, it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ ences that were a pleas@@ ant surpri@@ se.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys, the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent, industri@@ alized citiz@@ en@@ s, with perfec@@ tion the expect@@ ation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.
You will never be pleas@@ antly surpri@@ sed because your expect@@ ations, my expect@@ ations, have gone through the ro@@ of.
The secre@@ t to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secre@@ t to happiness is low expect@@ ations. I want to say --
just a little au@@ to@@ bio@@ graph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am mar@@ ried to a wi@@ f@@ e, and she's really quite wonder@@ ful.
I couldn't have done better.
I didn't sett@@ le. But sett@@ ling isn't always such a bad thing.
Fin@@ ally -- One consequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ itting pair of j@@ e@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed, and you ask wh@@ y,
who's responsi@@ ble, the answer is clear@@ : the world is responsi@@ ble.
What could you do?
When there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of j@@ e@@ ans avail@@ able, and you buy one that is disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ing, and you ask wh@@ y, who's responsi@@ ble@@ ? It is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is "@@ you@@ ."
You could have done better.
With a hundred different kinds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ play, there is no exc@@ use for fail@@ ure.
And so when people make deci@@ sions, and even though the results of the deci@@ sions are good, they feel disap@@ poin@@ ted about them@@ ; they bl@@ ame themselves.
C@@ lin@@ ical depres@@ sion has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last gener@@ ation.
I believe a significant -- not the on@@ ly, but a significant -- contribut@@ or to this explo@@ sion of depres@@ sion, and also su@@ ic@@ id@@ e, is that people have experi@@ ences that are disap@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ards are so high@@ ,
and then when they have to explain these experi@@ ences to them@@ selves, they think they're at fa@@ ul@@ t.
And so the net result is that we do better in gener@@ al, objec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, and we feel wor@@ se.
So let me re@@ mind you.
This is the off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma@@ , the one that we all take to be tru@@ e, and it's all f@@ al@@ se. It is not true.
There's no question that some choice is better than n@@ one, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some cho@@ ice.
There's some mag@@ ical amoun@@ t. I don't know what it is.
I'm pretty confid@@ ent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions impro@@ ve our w@@ el@@ far@@ e.
Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done -- as a policy mat@@ ter, the thing to think about is this:
what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial socie@@ ties is material aff@@ lu@@ ence.
There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much cho@@ ice.
The@@ ir problem is that they have too litt@@ le.
So the stuff I'm talking about is the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of moder@@ n, aff@@ lu@@ ent, Western socie@@ ti@@ es.
And what is so fr@@ ustr@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this: Ste@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t talked to you yester@@ day about how these expensive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don't hel@@ p.
What I'm telling you is that these expen@@ si@@ ve, complicated cho@@ ices -- it's not simply that they don't hel@@ p.
They actually hur@@ t.
They actually make us wor@@ se off.
If some of what en@@ ables people in our socie@@ ties to make all of the cho@@ ices we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to socie@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions, not only would those people's lives be impro@@ ved, but our@@ s would be impro@@ ved also,
which is what econom@@ ists call a "P@@ are@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving mo@@ ve@@ ."
In@@ come re@@ distribu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this exc@@ ess choice pl@@ agu@@ es us.
So to conc@@ lu@@ de. [@@ You can be anything you want to be -- no lim@@ it@@ s@@ ]
You're supposed to read this car@@ to@@ on, and, being a s@@ ophi@@ stic@@ ated person, say, "A@@ h@@ ! What does this fish know?
You know, nothing is possible in this fish@@ b@@ ow@@ l@@ ."
I@@ m@@ pover@@ ish@@ ed imagin@@ ation, a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world --
and that's the way I read it at fir@@ st.
The more I thought about it, how@@ ever, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something.
Because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fish@@ b@@ ow@@ l so that everything is possi@@ ble, you don't have fre@@ ed@@ om. You have par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s.
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this fish@@ b@@ ow@@ l so that everything is possi@@ ble, you dec@@ re@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion.
You increase par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s, and you dec@@ re@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion.
Everybody needs a fish@@ b@@ ow@@ l@@ .
This one is almost certainly too lim@@ ited -- perhaps even for the fish@@ , certainly for us.
But the ab@@ s@@ ence of some metaph@@ or@@ ical fish@@ b@@ ow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ er@@ y, and, I sus@@ pec@@ t, disa@@ st@@ er.
Thank you very much.
