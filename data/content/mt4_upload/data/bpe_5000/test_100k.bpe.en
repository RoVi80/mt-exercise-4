S@@ ever@@ al years ago here at TED@@ , Pe@@ ter S@@ k@@ ill@@ man introduc@@ ed a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challeng@@ e.
And the ide@@ a's pretty sim@@ ple@@ :
Te@@ ams of four have to build the tal@@ le@@ st fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 stic@@ ks of sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ ti@@ , one y@@ ard of ta@@ p@@ e, one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow@@ .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top@@ .
And, though it seems really simp@@ le, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly.
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea, and I inc@@ or@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop@@ .
And it was a huge succ@@ ess.
And since then, I've conduc@@ ted about 70 design work@@ shop@@ s across the world with students and designers and architec@@ ts, even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the For@@ tun@@ e 50@@ ,
and there's something about this exer@@ ci@@ se that reve@@ als very deep less@@ ons about the nature of collabor@@ ation, and I'd like to share some of them with you.
So, norm@@ ally, most people begin by ori@@ ent@@ ing themselves to the t@@ as@@ k.
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they j@@ oc@@ key for power. Then they spend some time plan@@ ning, organiz@@ ing,
they ske@@ t@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ ti@@ .
They spend the maj@@ ority of their time assem@@ bl@@ ing the stic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ growing struc@@ ture@@ s. And then finally, just as they're running out of time, someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow@@ , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top@@ , and then they stand back, and -- ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! --
they ad@@ m@@ ire their work.
But what really happen@@ s, most of the time, is that the "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " turns into an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ ," because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to buc@@ k@@ le and to collap@@ se.
So there are a number of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " mom@@ ents than other@@ s, and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school.
They li@@ e, they che@@ at, they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame struc@@ ture@@ s.
And of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " struc@@ ture@@ s, and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ t@@ en.
And it's pretty amaz@@ ing.
As Pe@@ ter tells us, not only do they produce the tal@@ le@@ st struc@@ ture@@ s, but they're the most interesting struc@@ tures of them all.
So the question you want to ask is: How com@@ e? Why? What is it about them@@ ?
And Pe@@ ter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti@@ , In@@ c@@ . Right?
They don't spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power.
But there's another reason as well.
And the reason is that business students are tra@@ ined to find the single right plan@@ , right?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it.
And then what happens is, when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top@@ , they run out of time and what happen@@ s?
It's a crisi@@ s.
S@@ ound famili@@ ar@@ ? Ri@@ ght.
What kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow@@ , and they build proto@@ typ@@ es, succ@@ es@@ sive proto@@ typ@@ es, always keep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top@@ , so they have multi@@ ple times to fix when they build proto@@ types along the way.
Des@@ ig@@ ners recognize this type of collabor@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the iter@@ ative process.
And with each ver@@ sion, kids get inst@@ ant feed@@ back about what works and what doesn't work.
So the capacity to play in proto@@ type is really ess@@ enti@@ al, but let's look at how different te@@ ams perform@@ .
So the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es; business schools stud@@ ents, about half of that@@ ; law@@ y@@ ers, a little better, but not much better than that, kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers, better than most adul@@ ts.
Who does the very be@@ st@@ ?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts and engine@@ ers, than@@ k@@ ful@@ ly.
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ nine in@@ ches is the tal@@ le@@ st structure I've se@@ en.
And why is it? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ re@@ in@@ forc@@ ing ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical patterns are the key to building st@@ able struc@@ ture@@ s.
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s, a little bit better than aver@@ age,
but here's where it gets interesting.
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am, they get signific@@ antly better.
It's incredi@@ ble. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that te@@ am@@ 's going to win@@ ." You can just tell before@@ hand. And why is that?
Because they have special sk@@ ills of fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation.
They man@@ age the process, they understand the process.
And any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly impro@@ ve the te@@ am@@ 's perform@@ ance.
S@@ peci@@ alized sk@@ ills and fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation sk@@ ills are the combin@@ ation that leads to strong succ@@ ess.
If you have 10 te@@ ams that ty@@ pic@@ ally perform@@ , you'll get maybe six or so that have standing struc@@ ture@@ s.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's up the ant@@ e, on@@ c@@ e.
So I off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar pri@@ ze of software to the win@@ ning te@@ am.
So what do you think happened to these design stud@@ ent@@ s?
What was the resul@@ t?
Here's what happen@@ ed@@ :
Not one team had a standing structure.
If anyone had buil@@ t, say, a one inc@@ h struc@@ ture, they would have taken home the pri@@ z@@ e.
So, isn't that interest@@ ing? That high sta@@ kes have a strong impac@@ t.
We did the exer@@ ci@@ se again with the same stud@@ ents.
What do you think happened th@@ en@@ ?
So now they understand the value of proto@@ typ@@ ing.
So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very be@@ st.
They produced the tal@@ le@@ st struc@@ tures in the least amount of time.
So there's deep less@@ ons for us about the nature of inc@@ enti@@ ves and succ@@ ess. So, you might as@@ k@@ : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challen@@ ge@@ ?
And the reason is, I help create digital tools and proc@@ esses to help te@@ ams build cars and video games and visual effec@@ ts.
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identi@@ fy the hi@@ dden assum@@ p@@ tions.
Bec@@ au@@ se, fr@@ ank@@ ly, every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow@@ , doesn't it?
The challenge provi@@ des a shar@@ ed experi@@ ence, a common langu@@ age, a common st@@ ance to build the right proto@@ typ@@ e.
And so, this is the value of the experi@@ ence, of this so simple exer@@ ci@@ se.
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .
It's a blo@@ g that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow@@ s.
There's ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this.
There are crazy examples from around the world of how people t@@ wea@@ k and ad@@ just the system.
There's world recor@@ ds that are on this as well.
And the fundamental less@@ on, I believ@@ e, is that design truly is a cont@@ act spor@@ t.
It de@@ man@@ ds that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the t@@ as@@ k, and that we apply the very best of our thinking, our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand.
And some@@ times, a little proto@@ type of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " moment to a "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " moment.
And that can make a big differ@@ ence.
Thank you very much.
Let's pret@@ end right here we have a machine. A big machin@@ e, a cool@@ , TED@@ -@@ ish machin@@ e, and it's a time machine.
And everyone in this room has to get into it.
And you can go back@@ war@@ ds, you can go forwar@@ d@@ s; you cannot stay where you are.
And I wonder what you'd choo@@ se, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go back.
I don't know. They want to go back before there were autom@@ o@@ bi@@ les or T@@ wit@@ ter or "@@ American I@@ dol@@ ."
I don't know.
I'm conv@@ inc@@ ed that there's some sort of pull to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a, to wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ king.
And I understand that.
I'm not part of that crow@@ d, I have to sa@@ y.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous. It's because possibil@@ ities on this planet, they don't go back, they go forwar@@ d.
So I want to get in the machin@@ e, and I want to go forwar@@ d.
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choo@@ se@@ : heal@@ th, weal@@ th, mo@@ bil@@ ity, opportun@@ ity, dec@@ lin@@ ing r@@ ates of disease ...
There's never been a time like this.
My great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents di@@ ed, all of them, by the time they were 60@@ .
My grand@@ parents pus@@ hed that number to 7@@ 0@@ .
My parents are clo@@ sing in on 8@@ 0@@ .
So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death num@@ ber.
But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigger deal than that.
A kid born in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can expect to live as long as the ric@@ h@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago.
Think about that, it's an incredible fac@@ t.
And why is it tru@@ e?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x. S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet.
It res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graph@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever ha@@ s.
It's g@@ one. It's v@@ an@@ ish@@ ed.
We v@@ an@@ qu@@ ish@@ ed it. P@@ u@@ ff@@ .
In the rich world, disea@@ ses that thre@@ at@@ ened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist@@ , har@@ d@@ ly.
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia, ru@@ bel@@ la@@ , po@@ li@@ o ...
does anyone even know what those things are@@ ?
V@@ acc@@ in@@ es, modern medic@@ ine, our ability to feed billions of people, those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific me@@ tho@@ d.
And to my mind, the scientific me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out, seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of human@@ ity.
So that's the good new@@ s.
Un@@ fortunately, that's all the good news because there are some other problem@@ s, and they've been mention@@ ed many times. And one of them is that des@@ p@@ ite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments, a billion people go to bed hun@@ gr@@ y in this world every day.
That number@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's ri@@ sing really rap@@ id@@ ly, and it's dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful.
And not only that, we've used our imagin@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tr@@ ash this g@@ lo@@ be.
Po@@ table water, ar@@ able land, rain@@ fore@@ sts, o@@ il, gas@@ : they're going away, and they're going away so@@ on, and un@@ less we innov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess, we're going away too.
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can@@ .
I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the land that they live on.
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destro@@ y it.
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain@@ 't wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ king.
But here's the thing that keep@@ s me up at night -- one of the things that keep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght@@ :
We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. N@@ ever. And we've also never been in a position to dep@@ lo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today.
We're on the ver@@ ge of amaz@@ ing, amazing ev@@ ents in many fiel@@ ds,
and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundre@@ ds, 300 years, before the En@@ light@@ en@@ ment, to find a time when we batt@@ led progres@@ s, when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously, on more fron@@ ts, than we do now.
People w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their beli@@ ef@@ s, and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can't set them fre@@ e.
Not even the truth will set them fre@@ e.
And, list@@ en, every@@ one's ent@@ it@@ led to their opini@@ on@@ ; they're even ent@@ it@@ led to their opini@@ on about progres@@ s. But you know what you're not ent@@ it@@ led to@@ ?
You're not ent@@ it@@ led to your own fac@@ ts. S@@ or@@ ry, you're not.
And this took me a@@ while to figure out.
Ab@@ out a decad@@ e ago, I wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ k@@ er. A little story.
And I was amaz@@ ed to find op@@ positi@@ on@@ : op@@ position to what is, after all, the most effec@@ tive public health measure in human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do@@ : I wrote a story and I moved on.
And soon after that, I wrote a story about gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered food.
S@@ ame thing, only big@@ g@@ er.
People were going craz@@ y.
So I wrote a story about that too, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was "@@ F@@ ran@@ k@@ en@@ foo@@ d@@ s@@ ," why they thought moving molecu@@ les around in a speci@@ fic@@ , rather than a ha@@ pha@@ z@@ ard way, was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nature@@ 's ground.
But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.
I mean, I'm a journ@@ alist@@ . We typ@@ e, we fi@@ le, we go to din@@ n@@ er. It's fin@@ e.
But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me, and I couldn't figure out wh@@ y, and eventually I did.
And that's because those f@@ an@@ at@@ ics that were driving me crazy weren't actually f@@ an@@ at@@ ics at all.
They were thou@@ ght@@ ful people, educ@@ ated people, dec@@ ent people.
They were exactly like the people in this room.
And it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much.
But then I thought, you know, let's be hon@@ est@@ . We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ly.
We talk about it in ir@@ onic terms with little quo@@ tes around it@@ : "@@ progres@@ s." Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.
We've lost fa@@ ith in institution@@ s, in author@@ ity, and sometimes in science it@@ self, and there's no reason we shouldn't have.
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will underst@@ and.
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l, B@@ hop@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, Vi@@ ox@@ x, weap@@ ons of mass destruc@@ tion, h@@ ang@@ ing cha@@ ds.
You know, you can choose your li@@ st.
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right,
so be ske@@ p@@ tic@@ al.
A@@ s@@ k questi@@ ons, dem@@ and pro@@ of, dem@@ and evid@@ ence.
Don't take anything for gr@@ an@@ ted.
But here's the thing@@ : When you get pro@@ of, you need to acc@@ ept the pro@@ of, and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epide@@ m@@ ic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
Ab@@ out 12 years ago, there was a story publi@@ sh@@ ed, a horri@@ ble story, that lin@@ ked the epide@@ m@@ ic of auti@@ s@@ m to the meas@@ les, m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ bel@@ la vacc@@ ine sho@@ t.
Very sc@@ ary.
T@@ ons of studies were done to see if this was true.
T@@ ons of studies should have been don@@ e; it's a serious issu@@ e.
The data came back.
The data came back from the United States, from Engl@@ and, from Swe@@ d@@ en, from Can@@ ad@@ a, and it was all the sam@@ e: no cor@@ rel@@ ation, no connec@@ tion, none at all.
It doesn't mat@@ ter. It doesn't matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ t@@ es, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel real@@ .
We don't believe a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government off@@ ic@@ ial giving us data, and I do understand that, I think we all do.
But you know what?
The result of that has been disa@@ st@@ rou@@ s.
Di@@ sa@@ st@@ rou@@ s because here's a fac@@ t: The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vacc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down.
That is dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful, and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed of our@@ selves.
It's horri@@ ble.
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that?
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.
Bec@@ au@@ se, did anyone have meas@@ les here?
H@@ as one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ le@@ s?
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't happen very much.
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't happen in this country at all, but it happened 1@@ 60@@ ,000 times in the world last year.
That's a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour@@ .
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our min@@ ds, and people like J@@ en@@ ny Mc@@ Car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing messa@@ ges of fear and ill@@ iter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like "O@@ pra@@ h@@ " and "@@ L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve@@ ."
And they can do it because they don't lin@@ k ca@@ us@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation.
They don't understand that these things seem the sam@@ e, but they're almost never the sam@@ e.
And it's something we need to lear@@ n, and we need to learn it really so@@ on.
This guy was a her@@ o, J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k.
He took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us.
No f@@ ear@@ , no ag@@ on@@ y. Po@@ li@@ o -- pu@@ ff@@ , g@@ one.
That guy in the midd@@ le, not so much.
His name is Paul O@@ ff@@ it.
He just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus vacc@@ ine with a bunch of other people.
It@@ 'll save the lives of 400 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 kids in the developing world every year.
Pre@@ t@@ ty good, right?
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valu@@ able they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing.
And he actually says it that way.
So, P@@ a@@ ul@@ 's a terr@@ or@@ ist@@ .
When Paul spea@@ ks in a public hear@@ ing, he can't te@@ st@@ if@@ y without arm@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds.
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school.
And wh@@ y? Because Paul made a vacc@@ ine.
I don't need to say this, but vacc@@ ines are ess@@ enti@@ al.
You take them away, disease comes back, horri@@ ble dise@@ as@@ es. And that's happen@@ ing.
We have meas@@ les in this country now.
And it's getting wor@@ se, and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.
And they're not just going to die of meas@@ les.
What about po@@ li@@ o@@ ? Let's have that. Why no@@ t?
A colle@@ ge clas@@ sm@@ ate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ d@@ ent.
No one's ever said that before.
She wasn't going to vacc@@ in@@ ate her kid against po@@ li@@ o,
no way.
F@@ ine.
Why? Because we don't have po@@ li@@ o. And you know what?
We didn't have po@@ li@@ o in this country yester@@ day.
To@@ day, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ago@@ s this morning, and he's flying to L@@ A@@ X@@ , right now he's over O@@ hi@@ o.
And he's going to land in a couple of hour@@ s, he's going to r@@ ent a car, and he's going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach@@ , and he's going to att@@ end one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous TED din@@ ners ton@@ i@@ ght.
And he doesn't know that he's infec@@ ted with a par@@ al@@ y@@ tic disease, and we don't either because that's the way the world works.
That's the planet we live on. Don't pret@@ end it is@@ n@@ 't.
Now, we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in li@@ es. We love to do it.
Every@@ one take their vit@@ am@@ ins this mor@@ n@@ ing?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ace@@ a, a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you go@@ ing.
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.
They take the stuff, and they take altern@@ ative medic@@ in@@ es, and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're use@@ less.
The data says it all the time.
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine. They almost never do more than that.
It's oka@@ y, you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine@@ ? I'm totally with you.
Dar@@ k ur@@ ine. Dar@@ k.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well, I think I underst@@ and, we h@@ ate Big P@@ har@@ ma@@ .
We h@@ ate Big G@@ over@@ n@@ ment. We don't tr@@ ust the M@@ an.
And we shoul@@ dn@@ '@@ t: Our health care system suc@@ ks.
It's cru@@ el to millions of people.
It's absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly c@@ old and s@@ oul@@ -@@ b@@ ending to those of us who can even affor@@ d it.
So we run away from it, and where do we run@@ ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of Big P@@ l@@ ace@@ bo@@ .
That's fanta@@ st@@ ic. I love Big P@@ l@@ ace@@ bo@@ .
But, you know, it's really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p, and we spend billions of dollars on it.
And I have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here.
N@@ one of it ... g@@ ink@@ go, f@@ ra@@ u@@ d@@ ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ace@@ a, f@@ ra@@ u@@ d@@ ; aca@@ i -- I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's f@@ ra@@ u@@ d.
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people sc@@ ream at me, and they say, "What do you car@@ e? Let people do what they want to do.
It makes them feel good@@ ."
And you know what? You're wrong.
Because I don't care if it's the secre@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who's saying, "H@@ m@@ m, I'm not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ ts on m@@ am@@ mo@@ gram@@ s@@ ," or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee en@@ em@@ as.
When you start down the road where beli@@ ef and magic re@@ place evidence and science, you end up in a place you don't want to be.
You end up in T@@ ha@@ b@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i South Africa.
He killed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ sist@@ ing that be@@ et@@ roo@@ t, gar@@ lic and lem@@ on oil were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al dru@@ gs we know can slow the course of AID@@ S.
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pl@@ agu@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this disease.
P@@ lea@@ se, don't tell me there are no consequ@@ ences to these things.
There are. There always are.
Now, the most min@@ d@@ less epide@@ m@@ ic we're in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d batt@@ le between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered food and the organic el@@ it@@ e.
It's an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic deb@@ ate. It has to stop@@ .
It's a deb@@ ate about words, about metaph@@ ors.
It's ide@@ o@@ logy, it's not science.
Every single thing we e@@ at, every gra@@ in of r@@ ice, every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y, every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fied by man.
You know, there weren't t@@ ang@@ er@@ ines in the gar@@ den of E@@ d@@ en.
There wasn't any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e.
There weren't Christ@@ m@@ as tre@@ es. We made it all.
We made it over the last 11@@ ,000 years.
And some of it wor@@ ked, and some of it di@@ dn@@ 't.
We got rid of the stuff that di@@ dn@@ 't.
Now we can do it in a more preci@@ se way --
and there are ri@@ sk@@ s, absolutely --
but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in A into r@@ ice, and that stuff can help millions of people, millions of people, pro@@ long their lives.
You don't want to do that?
I have to say, I don't understand it.
We object to gene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered food.
Why do we do that?
Well, the things I const@@ antly hear are@@ : To@@ o many chem@@ ic@@ als, pe@@ stic@@ id@@ es, hor@@ mon@@ es, mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture, we don't want giant fiel@@ ds of the same thing, that's wrong.
We don't companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life.
We don't want companies ow@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s.
And you know what my response to all of that is@@ ?
Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.
It's tru@@ e, we've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science.
This has nothing to do with science.
It's law@@ , it's mor@@ al@@ ity, it's pat@@ ent stuff.
You know science isn't a compan@@ y.
It's not a country.
It's not even an ide@@ a@@ ; it's a process.
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it does@@ n@@ 't, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're af@@ rai@@ d, is really very de@@ ad@@ en@@ ing, and it's pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sper@@ ing.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now, 70 percent.
This invest@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years.
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful. D@@ is@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful.
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.
And wh@@ y? G@@ ene@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ ered food.
We don't want to encou@@ rage people to eat that ro@@ tt@@ en stuff, like cas@@ sa@@ v@@ a for inst@@ ance.
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a's something that half a billion people e@@ at.
It's kind of like a pot@@ at@@ o.
It's just a bunch of cal@@ ori@@ es. It suc@@ ks.
It doesn't have n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents, it doesn't have prote@@ in, and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now.
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blin@@ d.
They wouldn't star@@ ve, and you know what?
That would be n@@ ice. It wouldn't be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se, but it would be n@@ ice.
And all I can say about this is: Why are we fi@@ ghting it?
I mean, let's ask our@@ sel@@ v@@ es: Why are we fi@@ ghting it?
Because we don't want to move genes ar@@ ound@@ ?
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chem@@ ic@@ als.
It's not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous pas@@ sion for hor@@ mon@@ es, our in@@ sist@@ ence on having bigger food, better food, sing@@ ular food.
This isn't about R@@ ice K@@ ri@@ sp@@ ies,
this is about keep@@ ing people ali@@ ve, and it's about time we started to understand what that mean@@ t.
Bec@@ au@@ se, you know some@@ thing@@ ? If we don@@ 't, if we continue to act the way we're ac@@ t@@ ing, we're gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don't think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of@@ : high-@@ tec@@ h colon@@ i@@ al@@ ism.
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.
It's sel@@ fish@@ , it's ug@@ ly, it's bene@@ ath us, and we really have to stop it.
So after this amaz@@ ingly fun convers@@ ation, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time machine and go forwar@@ d@@ ?"
Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely. Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely, I do.
It's st@@ uck in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportun@@ ity.
We can set that time machine on anything we want.
We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it.
We have to have these convers@@ ations and we have to think, but when we get in the time machine and we go a@@ head, we're going to be happy we do.
I know that we can, and as far as I'm concer@@ ne@@ d, that's something the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
One day, L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Tim@@ es col@@ um@@ ni@@ st Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was walking along the stre@@ ets of down@@ town L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les when he heard beautiful music.
And the source was a man, an Afric@@ an@@ -@@ American man, char@@ m@@ ing, ru@@ g@@ ge@@ d, home@@ less, playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Ste@@ v@@ e's col@@ um@@ ns became the bas@@ is for a book, which was turned into a movi@@ e, with Rob@@ ert D@@ ow@@ ne@@ y J@@ r. ac@@ ting as Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z@@ , and J@@ ami@@ e F@@ ox@@ x as N@@ a@@ than@@ i@@ el An@@ th@@ ony A@@ y@@ ers, the Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined dou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st whose prom@@ is@@ ing care@@ er was cut short by a tra@@ gic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia.
N@@ a@@ than@@ i@@ el dro@@ pped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d, he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down, and 30 years later he was living home@@ less on the stre@@ ets of S@@ kid R@@ ow in down@@ town L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les.
I encou@@ rage all of you to read Ste@@ v@@ e's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that form@@ ed between these two m@@ en,
I'm Jan@@ e Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al. I'm a game design@@ er.
I've been making games online now for 10 years, and my goal for the next decad@@ e is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online gam@@ es.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it ent@@ ail@@ s conv@@ inc@@ ing more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better gam@@ es.
Ri@@ ght now we spend three billion hours a week playing online gam@@ es.
Some of you might be thinking, "@@ That's a lot of time to spend playing gam@@ es.
Maybe too much time, consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ g@@ ent problems we have to solve in the real world@@ ."
But actually, acc@@ or@@ ding to my research at the Instit@@ ute for the F@@ u@@ ture, actually the oppos@@ ite is true.
Thre@@ e billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most ur@@ g@@ ent problems.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase that total dram@@ at@@ ically.
I've calcul@@ ated the total we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every wee@@ k.
So, that's probably a bit of a coun@@ ter-@@ intu@@ itive idea, so I'll say it again, let it s@@ ink in@@ :
If we want to solve problems like hun@@ g@@ er, pover@@ ty, climate change, global conflic@@ t, ob@@ es@@ ity, I believe that we need to asp@@ ire to play games online for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a wee@@ k, by the end of the next decad@@ e. No. I'm seri@@ ous. I am.
Here's wh@@ y. This picture pretty much sum@@ s up why I think games are so ess@@ ential to the future surviv@@ al of the human speci@@ es. T@@ r@@ ul@@ y.
This is a por@@ tra@@ it by photograph@@ er P@@ hi@@ l To@@ le@@ d@@ an@@ o. He wanted to cap@@ ture the emo@@ tion of gam@@ ing,
so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were play@@ ing.
And this is a clas@@ si@@ c gam@@ ing emo@@ tion.
Now, if you're not a gam@@ er, you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this photo@@ .
You probably see the sense of ur@@ g@@ enc@@ y, a little bit of f@@ ear@@ , but inten@@ se concentr@@ ation, deep@@ , deep focus on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem.
If you are a gam@@ er, you will notice a few nu@@ ances her@@ e: the cr@@ ink@@ le of the eyes up, and around the m@@ outh is a sign of optim@@ ism,
and the e@@ ye@@ b@@ row@@ s up is surpri@@ se.
This is a gam@@ er who's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ ep@@ ic win@@ ."
Oh, you've heard of that.
OK, good, so we have some gam@@ ers among us.
An ep@@ ic win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positi@@ ve, you had no idea it was even possible until you achiev@@ ed it.
It was almost beyond the thre@@ sh@@ old of imagin@@ ation, and when you get there, you're sh@@ oc@@ ked to discover what you're truly cap@@ able of. That's an ep@@ ic w@@ in.
This is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic w@@ in.
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone wh@@ o, against all od@@ ds, is on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic w@@ in.
Now, un@@ fortun@@ ately this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent problems.
This is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Li@@ fe@@ " face. This is actually me making it. Can you see@@ ? Y@@ es. Goo@@ d.
This is me making the "I'm Not Good At Li@@ fe@@ " face.
This is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old neighbor@@ hood in Ber@@ ke@@ le@@ y, Californi@@ a, where I did my Ph@@ D on why we're better in games than we are in real life.
And this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in gam@@ es.
I don't mean just good as in success@@ ful, although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game world@@ s.
But I also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate.
And when we're in game worl@@ ds, I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a mom@@ ent@@ 's notic@@ e, the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it ta@@ k@@ es, to get up after fail@@ ure and try again.
And in real life, when we face fail@@ ure@@ , when we con@@ front ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les, we often don't feel that way. We feel over@@ com@@ e, we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d, we feel an@@ xi@@ ous, maybe depres@@ sed, fr@@ ustr@@ ated or cy@@ nic@@ al.
We never have those feel@@ ings when we're playing gam@@ es, they just don't ex@@ ist in gam@@ es.
So that's what I wanted to study when I was a gradu@@ ate stud@@ ent.
What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve every@@ thing@@ ?
How can we take those feel@@ ings from games and apply them to real@@ -@@ world work@@ ?
So I looked at games like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ f@@ t, which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving environment@@ .
And I started to notice a few things that make ep@@ ic win@@ s so possible in online world@@ s.
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these online gam@@ es, especially in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ f@@ t, there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are willing to tr@@ ust you with a world@@ -@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ sion, right away.
But not just any mis@@ sion, it's a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game.
Right? So you can do it.
They never give you a challenge you can't achiev@@ e.
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're cap@@ able of, so you have to try har@@ d.
But there's no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ f@@ t@@ ; no sitting around, wr@@ inging your hands -- there's always something specific and important to be done.
There are also tons of collabor@@ ator@@ s.
Every@@ where you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your ep@@ ic mis@@ sion.
That's not something we have in real life that eas@@ il@@ y, this sense that at our fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ator@@ s.
And there's this ep@@ ic story, this inspir@@ ing story of why we're there, and what we're doing,
and we get all this positive feed@@ back.
You guys have heard of level@@ ing up, +@@ 1 streng@@ th, +@@ 1 intellig@@ ence.
We don't get that kind of const@@ ant feed@@ back in real life.
When I get off this st@@ age, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 spea@@ king, and +@@ 1 crazy idea, +@@ 20 crazy idea.
I don't get that feed@@ back in real life.
Now, the problem with collabor@@ ative online environment@@ s like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft is that it's so s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win all the time, we decide to spend all our time in these game world@@ s.
It's just better than real@@ ity.
So, so far@@ , collec@@ tively all the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the virtual problems of A@@ zer@@ o@@ th.
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in cont@@ ext@@ : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earli@@ est pri@@ m@@ ate human ancest@@ ors st@@ ood up.
That was the first up@@ right pri@@ mat@@ e.
So when we talk about how much time we're curr@@ ently invest@@ ing in playing gam@@ es, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolution@@ , which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also ap@@ t, because it turns out that by spending all this time playing gam@@ es, we're actually changing what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ings. We're evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty speci@@ es.
This is true. I believe this.
So, consider this really interesting stati@@ stic@@ ;
it was recently published by a research@@ er at Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on Uni@@ vers@@ it@@ y:
The average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21@@ .
Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reas@@ ons.
First of all, for children in the United States, 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school, from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to high school gradu@@ ation, if you have perfect att@@ end@@ ance.
So, we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l tr@@ ack of education going on, where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they're learning about everything else in school.
Some of you have probably read Mal@@ col@@ m G@@ lad@@ well@@ 's new book "O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s@@ ,"
so you would have heard of his theory of succ@@ ess, the "@@ 10,000 hour@@ s" theory of succ@@ ess.
It's based on this great cogn@@ iti@@ ve-@@ science research that says if we can ma@@ ster 10,000 hours of effor@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21@@ , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it.
We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world.
And so, now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers.
So, the big question is, "What exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at@@ ?"
Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ented human res@@ ource on our hand@@ s.
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online gam@@ es.
These are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers,
500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something.
And in the next decad@@ e, we're going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is.
If you don't know it al@@ read@@ y, this is com@@ ing. The game industry is developing con@@ so@@ les that are low-@@ energy and that work with the wire@@ less phone net@@ works instead of broad@@ band Interne@@ t, so that gam@@ ers all over the world, particularly in India, Chin@@ a, Braz@@ il, can get on@@ line.
They expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decad@@ e.
It will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers.
So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at.
Here are the four things I came up with. The first is ur@@ g@@ ent optim@@ ism.
OK, think of this as extre@@ me self-@@ motiv@@ ation.
U@@ r@@ g@@ ent optim@@ ism is the des@@ ire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le, comb@@ ined with the beli@@ ef that we have a reason@@ able hope of succ@@ ess.
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an ep@@ ic win is possi@@ ble, and that it's always worth tr@@ ying, and trying now.
G@@ am@@ ers don't sit around.
G@@ am@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fab@@ r@@ ic.
There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ ly.
And the reason is, it takes a lot of tr@@ ust to play a game with some@@ one. We tr@@ ust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same ru@@ les, value the same go@@ al, stay with the game until it's over.
And so, playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation.
And we actually build strong@@ er social relationshi@@ ps as a resul@@ t.
B@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity. I love it.
You know, there's a reason why the average World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft gam@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a week -- kind of a half@@ -@@ time job.
It's because we know, when we're playing a gam@@ e, that we're actually happ@@ i@@ er working hard than we are re@@ la@@ x@@ ing, or h@@ ang@@ ing out.
We know that we are optim@@ ized as human be@@ ings, to do hard and mean@@ ing@@ ful work.
And gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work.
Fin@@ all@@ y: ep@@ ic mean@@ ing.
G@@ am@@ ers love to be att@@ ach@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stor@@ ies.
So, just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that helps put that into perspec@@ ti@@ ve@@ :
So, you all know Wikipedi@@ a, biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
Second biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world, with nearly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 artic@@ les, is the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft wi@@ ki@@ . F@@ ive million people use it every mon@@ th.
They have comp@@ il@@ ed more information about World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft on the Internet than any other top@@ ic cover@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
They are building an ep@@ ic story.
They are building an ep@@ ic knowledge res@@ ource about the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ f@@ t.
Okay, so these are four super@@ pow@@ ers that add up to one thing@@ :
G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed hope@@ ful individu@@ als.
These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of changing the world.
And the only problem is, they believe that they are cap@@ able of changing virtual worl@@ ds and not the real world.
That's the problem that I'm trying to sol@@ ve.
There's an econom@@ ist named E@@ d@@ ward C@@ astr@@ on@@ o@@ v@@ a.
His work is brilli@@ ant. He looks at why people are invest@@ ing so much time and energy and money in online world@@ s.
And he says, "@@ We're wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amoun@@ ts to no less than a mass ex@@ od@@ us to virtual worl@@ ds and online game environment@@ s."
And he's an econom@@ ist, so he's r@@ ation@@ al. And he says -- Not like me, I'm a game design@@ er@@ ; I'm ex@@ ub@@ er@@ ant.
But he says that this makes perfect sense, because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life.
They can have strong@@ er social relationshi@@ ps in games than they can have in real life@@ ;
they get better feed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life.
So he says, for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worl@@ ds than the real world. Now, I also agre@@ e that that is r@@ ation@@ al, for now. But it is not, by any mean@@ s, an optim@@ al situ@@ ation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game.
I take my inspir@@ ation from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago.
These are ancient dic@@ e, made out of she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les. Be@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game control@@ l@@ ers, we had she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les. And these re@@ present the first game equ@@ ip@@ ment designed by human be@@ ings,
and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Gre@@ e@@ k histor@@ ian Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, you might know this history,
which is the history of who invented games and wh@@ y.
Her@@ o@@ do@@ tu@@ s says that gam@@ es, particularly d@@ ice gam@@ es, were invented in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ di@@ a, during a time of fam@@ ine.
A@@ pp@@ ar@@ ently, there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a decided they had to do something craz@@ y.
People were suff@@ er@@ ing. People were fi@@ ght@@ ing. It was an extre@@ me situ@@ ation, they needed an extre@@ me solution@@ .
So, acc@@ or@@ ding to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they invented d@@ ice gam@@ es, and they set up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wide polic@@ y:
On one day, everybody would e@@ at,
and on the next day, everybody would play gam@@ es.
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in playing the d@@ ice gam@@ es, because games are so eng@@ ag@@ ing, and im@@ mer@@ se us in such s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying, b@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, they would ig@@ nor@@ e the fact that they had no food to e@@ at.
And then on the next day, they would play gam@@ es; and on the next day, they would e@@ at.
And acc@@ or@@ ding to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they passed 18 years this way, survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine, by eating on one day, and playing games on the nex@@ t.
Now, this is exac@@ t@@ ly, I think, how we're using games today. We're using games to es@@ cap@@ e real@@ -@@ world suff@@ ering --
we're using games to get away
from everything that's bro@@ ken in the real environment, everything that's not s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real life, and we're getting what we need from gam@@ es.
But it doesn't have to end there.
This is really excit@@ ing. Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn't getting better, so the king decided they would play one final d@@ ice game.
They divi@@ ded the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in half@@ . They played one d@@ ice gam@@ e, and the win@@ ners of that game got to go on an ep@@ ic adv@@ ent@@ ure.
They would leave L@@ y@@ di@@ a, and they would go out in search of a new place to li@@ ve, lea@@ ving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were avail@@ able, and hope@@ fully to take their civiliz@@ ation somewhere else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve.
Now, this sounds craz@@ y, right?
But rec@@ ently, DNA evidence has shown that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s, who then led to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re, actually share the same DNA as the ancient L@@ y@@ di@@ ans.
And so, rec@@ ently, scientists have sugge@@ sted that Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ ' crazy story is actually true.
And ge@@ o@@ logists have found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years, that could have explain@@ ed the fam@@ ine.
So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually sa@@ ved their culture by playing gam@@ es, es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years, and then been so inspi@@ re@@ d, and knew so much about how to come together with gam@@ es, that they actually sa@@ ved the entire civiliz@@ ation that way.
Okay, we can do that.
We've been playing W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft since 199@@ 4@@ .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time strateg@@ y game from the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft seri@@ es. That was 16 years ago.
They played d@@ ice games for 18 years, we've been playing W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft for 16 years.
I say we are ready for our own ep@@ ic game.
Now, they had half the civiliz@@ ation go off in search of a new world,
so that's where I get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play fr@@ om.
Let's get half of us to agre@@ e to spend an hour a day playing gam@@ es, until we solve real@@ -@@ world problems.
Now, I know you're as@@ king, "How are we going to solve real@@ -@@ world problems in gam@@ es@@ ?" Well, that's what I've de@@ vo@@ ted my work to over the past few years, at the Instit@@ ute for the F@@ u@@ ture.
We have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to, and it expres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future.
We do not want to try to predic@@ t the future.
What we want to do is make the future.
We want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o out@@ com@@ e, and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity.
We want to imagine ep@@ ic win@@ s, and then give people the means to achieve the ep@@ ic w@@ in.
I'm just going to very bri@@ ef@@ ly show you three games that I've made that are an attem@@ pt to give people the means to create ep@@ ic win@@ s in their own fu@@ ture@@ s.
This is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il.
We made this game in 200@@ 7@@ .
This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ t@@ age.
The oil shor@@ t@@ age is fic@@ tion@@ al, but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real@@ , and to live your real life as if we've run out of o@@ il. So when you come to the gam@@ e, you sign up, tell us where you li@@ ve, and then we give you real@@ -@@ time news vide@@ o@@ s, data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much oil co@@ sts, what's not avail@@ able, how food supply is being affec@@ ted,
how transpor@@ t@@ ation is being affec@@ ted, if schools are close@@ d, if there's ri@@ o@@ t@@ ing, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blo@@ g about it, to po@@ st vide@@ o@@ s, to po@@ st photo@@ s.
We pi@@ lo@@ ted this game with 1,@@ 7@@ 00 play@@ ers in 200@@ 7, and we've trac@@ ked them for the three years s@@ inc@@ e. And I can tell you that this is a transform@@ ative experience.
No@@ body wants to change how they li@@ ve, just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic adv@@ ent@@ ure and tell them, "@@ We've run out of o@@ il.
This is an amazing story and adv@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on.
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge yourself to see how you would survi@@ ve@@ ,"
most of our play@@ ers have kept up the ha@@ bits that they learned in this game.
So for the next world@@ -@@ sa@@ ving gam@@ e, we decided to ai@@ m higher -- bigger problem than just pea@@ k o@@ il.
We did a game called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the Instit@@ ute for the F@@ u@@ ture. And the pre@@ mi@@ se was, a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 2@@ 3 years left on the planet.
This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess Sy@@ stem@@ , of cour@@ se.
We asked people to come online -- almost like a J@@ er@@ ry Br@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movi@@ e.
You know J@@ er@@ ry Br@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movi@@ es, you form a dream team -- you've got the astr@@ on@@ au@@ t, the scienti@@ st, the ex@@ -@@ conv@@ ic@@ t, and they all have something to do to save the world. But in our gam@@ e, instead of just having five people on the dream te@@ am, we said, "@@ Every@@ body's on the dream te@@ am, and it's your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy, the future of food, the future of heal@@ th, the future of security and the future of the social safe@@ ty net@@ ."
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight wee@@ ks. They came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go on@@ line, Google "@@ Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t@@ ," and see.
So, finally, the last gam@@ e, we're laun@@ ching it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d. This is a game done with the World B@@ ank Instit@@ ut@@ e.
If you complete the gam@@ e, you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the World B@@ ank Instit@@ ute as a S@@ oc@@ ial In@@ no@@ v@@ ator@@ , class of 20@@ 10@@ .
Wor@@ king with univers@@ ities all over sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa, and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innovation sk@@ ill@@ s.
We've got a graph@@ ic no@@ vel@@ , we've got level@@ ing up in sk@@ ills like local insi@@ ght, knowledge net@@ work@@ ing, sustain@@ abil@@ ity, vision and resourc@@ e@@ ful@@ ness.
I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to please share this game with young people, anywhere in the world, particularly in developing are@@ as, who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pri@@ ses to save the world.
So, I'm going to w@@ ra@@ p up now.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think happens nex@@ t?
We've got all these amazing gam@@ ers, we've got these games that are kind of pi@@ lots of what we might do, but none of them have sa@@ ved the real world yet.
Well I hope you will agre@@ e with me that gam@@ ers are a human res@@ ource that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work, that games are a powerful plat@@ form for change. We have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s: b@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fab@@ r@@ ic, this feeling of ur@@ g@@ ent optim@@ ism and the des@@ ire for ep@@ ic mean@@ ing.
I really hope that we can come together to play games that mat@@ ter, to survive on this planet for another centur@@ y. That's my hop@@ e, that you will join me in making and playing games like this.
When I look forward to the next decad@@ e, I know two things for su@@ re@@ : that we can make any future we can imag@@ ine, and we can play any games we wan@@ t, so I sa@@ y:
Let the world@@ -@@ changing games beg@@ in.
Thank you.
For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effec@@ t, which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a mag@@ ician to be interested in, un@@ less you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "@@ Some@@ thing fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real@@ ." In other words, sug@@ ar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studi@@ es, the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effec@@ t, just because the person thinks
that what's happening to them is a ph@@ arm@@ ace@@ ut@@ ical or some sort of a --
for pain man@@ age@@ ment, for example, if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effec@@ t.
Some@@ thing fa@@ ke becomes something real because of some@@ one's percep@@ tion of it.
In order for us to understand each other, I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary, very simple magic tr@@ ic@@ k.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a tr@@ ick that's been in every childr@@ en's magic book since at least the 19@@ 50@@ s.
I learned it myself from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out M@@ ag@@ ic in the 197@@ 0@@ s.
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.
And then I'll explain why I explain@@ ed it.
So, here's what happen@@ s.
The k@@ ni@@ f@@ e, which you can exam@@ ine@@ ; my hand, which you could exam@@ ine.
I'm just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this.
I'll get my sle@@ eve back.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve
I'm just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here.
That way you can see that at no time can anything travel@@ , as long as I'm squ@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e.
And the object of this is quite simp@@ le.
I'm going to open my hand, and hope@@ ful@@ ly, if all is well, my p@@ ure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e.
In fact it's held so ti@@ ghtly in place that I can sha@@ ke it, and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off.
No@@ thing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e,
no tr@@ ick@@ er@@ y. And you can exam@@ ine everything.
Ta@@ -@@ da@@ !
So, this is a tr@@ ick that I often teach to young children
that are interested in mag@@ ic, because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ ep@@ tion by studying this very -- even though it's a very simple tr@@ ick me@@ tho@@ do@@ log@@ ically.
Pro@@ bab@@ ly many of you in the room know this tr@@ ic@@ k.
What happens is this. I hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand.
I say I'm going to gra@@ b hold of my w@@ ri@@ st
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.
The reason I'm holding onto my w@@ ri@@ st is because that's actually the secre@@ t of the ill@@ usi@@ on.
In a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you, this fing@@ er right here, my inde@@ x fing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is, to a position poin@@ ting out like this. N@@ ice one.
Some@@ one who didn't have a child@@ hood is out there.
So, it goes like this, from here, right.
And as I move around my fing@@ er shi@@ f@@ ts.
And we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive, why you don't notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here, because the mind, and the way it proc@@ esses information, it doesn't coun@@ t, one, two, thre@@ e. It groups them.
But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up. Ob@@ vi@@ ously it's cl@@ inging there, not by animal magne@@ ti@@ sm@@ , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y, my inde@@ x fing@@ er being there.
And then when I close my fing@@ er, same thing, as I move back, this mo@@ tion kind of cover@@ s the moving back of my fing@@ er.
I take this hand away. You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out.
There is a tr@@ ick you can do for your friends and neighbor@@ s. Than@@ ks.
Now, what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effec@@ t?
I read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide op@@ en.
I'm not a doc@@ tor or a research@@ er, so this, to me, was an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing.
It turns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in the form of a white p@@ ill, that's like asp@@ ir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it's just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effec@@ t.
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in, like you make a smaller p@@ ill, and color it blu@@ e, and st@@ am@@ p a let@@ ter into it, it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effec@@ tive.
Even though ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ arm@@ ace@@ ut@@ ical -- they're sug@@ ar p@@ ill@@ s.
But a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill.
Wh@@ at@@ ? That really fli@@ pped me out.
Tur@@ ns out though, that that's not even where it stop@@ s.
If you have cap@@ su@@ les, they're more effec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ lets in any form.
A colo@@ red cap@@ su@@ le, that's yel@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le.
D@@ osa@@ ge has something to do with this.
One p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- I don't remember the stati@@ stic now. S@@ or@@ ry.
But the point is ...
... these do@@ sa@@ ges have something to do with it.
And the form has something to do with it.
And if you want the ultim@@ ate in plac@@ e@@ bo@@ , you've go to the need@@ le.
Right? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ ert -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert something,
and you in@@ jec@@ t this into a patient ...
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind, it's so much strong@@ er than the white p@@ ill.
It's a really, this graph@@ , well I'll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ d@@ es.
The point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le.
And none of it has any real ph@@ arm@@ ace@@ ut@@ ical qual@@ ity,
it's only your beli@@ ef that makes it real in your body and makes a strong@@ er effec@@ t.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic tr@@ ic@@ k.
And take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke tr@@ ick and make it seem real@@ .
And we know from that study that when you want real@@ ity, you go to the need@@ le.
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ inc@@ h h@@ at@@ p@@ in. It's very, very shar@@ p,
and I'm going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit.
This is really my fle@@ sh. This is not D@@ ami@@ an@@ 's speci@@ al@@ -@@ grown fle@@ sh.
That's my skin right there. This is not a H@@ olly@@ wood special effec@@ t.
I'm going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side.
If you're qu@@ easy -- if you f@@ ain@@ t easi@@ ly -- I was doing this for some friends in the ho@@ te@@ l room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost passed out.
So, I sug@@ gest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact, you know what@@ , I'll do the first bad part behind it.
You@@ 'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.
So, here is what happen@@ s, right here, the beginning of my f@@ les@@ h at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pi@@ er@@ c@@ e.
I'm sor@@ ry, man. A@@ m I f@@ rea@@ king you out@@ ?
OK, and then just through my skin a tiny b@@ it, and then out the other side like this.
Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tr@@ ic@@ k.
S@@ ort of. But you can't coun@@ t my fing@@ ers right now can you@@ ?
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two three, four@@ , fi@@ ve. Yes, well@@ ...
I know what people think when they see this.
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dum@@ b enough to sta@@ b himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minut@@ es.
So, let me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k.
How@@ 's that look out ther@@ e? Pre@@ t@@ ty good.
Yeah, I know. And the people in the back go, "@@ OK, I didn't really see that@@ ."
People in the satell@@ ite room are starting to move in now.
Let me give you good close look at this.
That really is my sk@@ in. That is not a H@@ olly@@ wood special effec@@ t.
That's my fle@@ sh, and I can tw@@ ist that around.
I'm sor@@ ry. If you're getting qu@@ eas@@ y, look away, don't look at the thing.
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go, "@@ Well yeah, that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --
see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be ble@@ ed@@ ing.
Well let me work up some blood for you.
Yes, there it is.
Nor@@ m@@ ally now, I would take the need@@ le out.
I would clean off my ar@@ m, and I would show you that there are no w@@ ound@@ s.
But I think in this contex@@ t and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real@@ , I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the st@@ age.
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
I've loved only tw@@ o.
That first one, it was more like a pas@@ sionate aff@@ air@@ .
It was a beautiful fish@@ : fla@@ v@@ or@@ ful, tex@@ ture@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u@@ .
What a fish@@ .
Even better, it was farm@@ -@@ rais@@ ed to the supposed highest stand@@ ards of sustain@@ ability.
So you could feel good about sel@@ ling it.
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several month@@ s.
One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an ev@@ ent about the farm@@ 's sustain@@ ability.
"@@ Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y@@ ," I sai@@ d.
Here was a company trying to solve what's become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for us che@@ f@@ s:
How do we keep fish on our men@@ us@@ ?
For the past 50 years, we've been fish@@ ing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut fore@@ sts.
It's hard to over@@ state the destruc@@ tion.
N@@ ine@@ ty percent of large fish@@ , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as, the h@@ ali@@ but@@ s, the sal@@ mon@@ s, s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they've collap@@ sed.
There's almost nothing left.
So, for better or for wor@@ se, a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture, fish farm@@ ing, is going to be a part of our future.
A lot of argum@@ ents against it@@ :
F@@ ish far@@ ms pol@@ l@@ ute -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they're in@@ effici@@ ent. Take tun@@ a,
a major draw@@ back. It's got a feed con@@ version r@@ ati@@ o of 15 to one.
That means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en p@@ ounds of wild fish to get you one p@@ ound of far@@ m tun@@ a.
Not very sustain@@ able.
It doesn't ta@@ ste very good ei@@ ther.
So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right.
I wanted to support them.
The day before the ev@@ ent, I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the compan@@ y.
Let's call him D@@ on.
"@@ Don@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the fac@@ ts strai@@ ght, you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to se@@ a, you don't pol@@ lu@@ te@@ ."
"@@ That's right@@ ," he sai@@ d. "@@ We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted, not concentr@@ at@@ ed@@ ."
And then he ad@@ ded, "@@ We're basically a world un@@ to our@@ selves.
That feed con@@ version r@@ ati@@ o@@ ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ B@@ est in the busin@@ ess@@ ."
2@@ .@@ 5 to one, great.
"@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 what? What are you feed@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ Su@@ stain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ Gre@@ at@@ ," I sai@@ d. Go@@ t off the ph@@ one.
And that night, I was lying in be@@ d, and I thou@@ ght@@ : What the h@@ ell is a sustainable prote@@ in@@ ?
So the next day, just before the ev@@ ent, I called D@@ on.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, what are some examples of sustainable prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?"
He said he didn't know. He would ask around.
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the comp@@ any@@ ; no one could give me a straight answer
until finally, I got on the phone with the head bio@@ logi@@ st.
Let's call him D@@ on too.
"@@ Don@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some examples of sustainable prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?"
Well, he mention@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als, and then he said chick@@ en p@@ el@@ le@@ ts.
I said, "@@ Ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ el@@ let@@ s@@ ?"
He said, "@@ Yeah, fe@@ a@@ ther@@ s, sk@@ in, b@@ one me@@ al, sc@@ ra@@ ps, dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into feed@@ ."
I said, "What perc@@ ent@@ age of your feed is chick@@ en@@ ?"
Th@@ in@@ king, you know, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 perc@@ ent@@ ," he sai@@ d.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, what's sustainable about feed@@ ing chick@@ en to fish@@ ?"
There was a long pa@@ use on the line, and he said, "@@ There's just too much chick@@ en in the world@@ ."
I f@@ ell out of love with this fish@@ .
No, not because I'm some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous, good@@ y-@@ two sho@@ es foo@@ di@@ e.
I actually am.
No, I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fish because, I swe@@ ar to God, after that convers@@ ation, the fish ta@@ sted like chick@@ en.
This second fish@@ , it's a different kind of love story.
It's the rom@@ antic kin@@ d, the kind where the more you get to know your fish@@ , you love the fish@@ .
I first ate it at a restaur@@ ant in sou@@ thern S@@ pain@@ .
A journ@@ ali@@ st friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.
She kind of set us up.
It came to the table a bri@@ ght, almost sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing, white col@@ or.
The che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it.
Like twice over.
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, it was still del@@ ici@@ ous.
Who can make a fish ta@@ ste good after it's been over@@ coo@@ ke@@ d?
I can@@ 't, but this guy can@@ .
Let's call him M@@ ig@@ u@@ el --
actually his name is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el.
And no, he didn't coo@@ k the fish@@ , and he's not a che@@ f@@ ,
at least in the way that you and I understand it.
He's a bio@@ logist at V@@ et@@ a L@@ a P@@ al@@ ma@@ . It's a fish far@@ m in the sou@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n cor@@ ner of S@@ pain@@ . It's at the ti@@ p of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver.
Un@@ til the 198@@ 0s, the far@@ m was in the hands of the Ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans.
They rais@@ ed be@@ ef c@@ att@@ le on what was essentially we@@ t@@ land@@ s.
They did it by dra@@ ining the land. They built this in@@ tr@@ ic@@ ate series of can@@ als, and they pus@@ hed water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver.
Well, they couldn't make it work, not econom@@ ically.
And eco@@ log@@ ically, it was a disa@@ st@@ er.
It killed like 90 percent of the bir@@ ds, which, for this place, is a lot of bir@@ ds.
And so in 198@@ 2, a S@@ pan@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ cha@@ sed the land.
What did they do?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the flow of water.
They literally fli@@ pped the swit@@ ch.
Inste@@ ad of pus@@ hing water out, they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back in.
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als.
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,000@@ -@@ ac@@ re fish far@@ m -- bas@@ s, mul@@ le@@ t, sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p, e@@ el -- and in the process, M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the eco@@ logical destruc@@ tion.
The farm@@ 's incredi@@ ble.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
You st@@ are out at a hor@@ iz@@ on that is a million miles away, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick, rich mar@@ sh@@ land.
I was there not long ago with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el.
He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Dar@@ win and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ d@@ ile D@@ un@@ de@@ e.
Oka@@ y? There we are s@@ log@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ land@@ s, and I'm pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating, got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es, and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ 's cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture.
Her@@ e, he's poin@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ack@@ -@@ shoul@@ dered K@@ it@@ e.
Now, he's mention@@ ing the min@@ eral needs of ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on. And here, here he se@@ es a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the T@@ anz@@ an@@ ian G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e.
It turns out, M@@ ig@@ u@@ el spent the better part of his care@@ er in the Mi@@ k@@ um@@ i National Par@@ k in Africa.
I asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish@@ .
He said, "@@ F@@ ish@@ ? I didn't know anything about fish@@ .
I'm an exper@@ t in relationshi@@ p@@ s."
And then he's off, laun@@ ching into more talk about r@@ are bir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange a@@ qu@@ atic plan@@ ts.
And don't get me wrong@@ , that was really fascin@@ ating, you know, the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ge@@ d, kind of thing.
It's great@@ , but I was in love.
And my head was sw@@ o@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of del@@ ici@@ ous fish I had the night before.
So I inter@@ rup@@ ted him. I said, "M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, what makes your fish ta@@ ste so good@@ ?"
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e.
"I know, du@@ de, the al@@ ga@@ e, the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the relationshi@@ p@@ s: It's amaz@@ ing.
But what are your fish e@@ at@@ ing?
What's the feed con@@ version r@@ ati@@ o@@ ?"
Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the w@@ il@@ d.
The plant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s, the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the z@@ o@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on, it's what fe@@ eds the fish@@ .
The system is so health@@ y, it's totally self-@@ ren@@ ew@@ ing.
There is no fe@@ ed.
E@@ ver heard of a far@@ m that doesn't feed its anim@@ al@@ s?
L@@ at@@ er that day, I was driving around this proper@@ ty with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, and I asked him, I said, "@@ For a place that seems so natur@@ al, un@@ like like any far@@ m I'd ever been at, how do you measure success@@ ?"
At that moment, it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set change.
And we r@@ ounded the cor@@ ner and saw the most amazing si@@ ght@@ : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could see.
"@@ That's success@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ Look at their bel@@ li@@ es, p@@ in@@ k.
They're fe@@ ast@@ ing."
F@@ ea@@ st@@ ing? I was totally con@@ fu@@ sed.
I said, "M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, aren't they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish@@ ?"
"@@ Y@@ es@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish e@@ gg@@ s to bir@@ ds.
Well, last year, this proper@@ ty had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 bir@@ ds on it, more than 2@@ 50 different speci@@ es.
It's be@@ com@@ e, today, the largest and one of the most important private bird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ aries in all of Europe@@ ."
I said, "M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, isn't a th@@ ri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm@@ ?"
He shoo@@ k his head, no.
He said, "We far@@ m ext@@ en@@ si@@ vel@@ y, not inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
This is an eco@@ logical net@@ work.
The fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os eat the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p.
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p eat the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
So the p@@ in@@ ker the bel@@ ly, the better the system@@ ."
Okay, so let's re@@ view@@ : a far@@ m that doesn't feed its animals, and a far@@ m that measure@@ s its success on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors.
A fish far@@ m, but also a bird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary.
Oh, and by the way, those fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, they shouldn't even be there in the first place.
They bro@@ od in a town 1@@ 50 miles away, where the so@@ il conditions are better for building ne@@ sts.
Every morning, they fly 1@@ 50 miles into the far@@ m. And every ev@@ en@@ ing, they fly 1@@ 50 miles back.
They do that because they're able to follow the bro@@ ken white line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2.
No k@@ idd@@ ing.
I was imag@@ ining a "@@ Mar@@ ch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ in@@ s" thing, so I looked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el.
I said, "M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, do they fly 1@@ 50 miles to the far@@ m, and then do they fly 1@@ 50 miles back at ni@@ ght?
Do they do that for the childr@@ en@@ ?"
He looked at me like I had just quo@@ ted a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on song@@ .
He said, "@@ No@@ ; they do it because the foo@@ d's bet@@ ter@@ ."
I didn't men@@ tion the skin of my be@@ loved fish@@ , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don't like fish sk@@ in@@ ;
I don't like it se@@ ar@@ ed, I don't like it cri@@ sp@@ y.
It's that ac@@ ri@@ d, tar@@ -@@ like fla@@ v@@ or.
I almost never coo@@ k with it.
Y@@ et, when I ta@@ sted it at that restaur@@ ant in sou@@ thern S@@ pain@@ , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish sk@@ in.
It ta@@ sted swe@@ et and cle@@ an, like you were taking a b@@ ite of the oce@@ an.
I mention@@ ed that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, and he no@@ d@@ ded.
He said, "The skin ac@@ ts like a sp@@ ong@@ e.
It's the last def@@ en@@ se before anything ent@@ ers the body.
It evolved to so@@ a@@ k up imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es."
And then he ad@@ ded, "@@ But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es."
OK. A far@@ m that doesn't feed its fish@@ ,
a far@@ m that measure@@ s its success by the success of its pre@@ dat@@ ors.
And then I realized when he says, "@@ A far@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ," he made a big underst@@ at@@ em@@ ent, because the water that flow@@ s through that far@@ m comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver. It's a ri@@ ver that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these da@@ ys@@ : chemical cont@@ am@@ in@@ an@@ ts, pe@@ st@@ ici@@ de ru@@ no@@ ff@@ .
And when it works its way through the system and lea@@ ves, the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it enter@@ ed.
The system is so health@@ y, it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water.
So, not just a far@@ m that doesn't feed its animals, not just a far@@ m that measure@@ s its success by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors, but a far@@ m that's literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation plant -- and not just for those fish@@ , but for you and me as well.
Because when that water lea@@ ves, it dum@@ ps out into the At@@ lan@@ tic@@ .
A drop in the oce@@ an, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, how@@ ever rom@@ an@@ tic@@ , is also in@@ struc@@ tive.
You might say it's a reci@@ pe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef c@@ att@@ le.
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new concep@@ tion of agricul@@ ture, one in which the food actually ta@@ st@@ es good.
But for a lot people, that's a bit too ra@@ dic@@ al.
We're not real@@ ist@@ s, us foo@@ di@@ es;
we're lo@@ ver@@ s.
We love far@@ mer@@ s' marke@@ ts,
we love small family farm@@ s,
we talk about local food,
we eat organ@@ ic.
And when you sug@@ gest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food, some@@ one, somewhere st@@ ands up and says, "@@ He@@ y guy, I love p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, but how are you going to feed the world@@ ?"
How are you going to feed the world@@ ?
Can I be hon@@ est@@ ?
I don't love that question.
No, not because we already produce enough cal@@ or@@ ies to more than feed the world.
One billion people will go hun@@ gr@@ y today.
One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of g@@ ross ine@@ qual@@ ities in distribu@@ tion, not ton@@ n@@ age.
Now, I don't love this question because it's determin@@ ed the logi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years.
Fe@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ v@@ ore@@ s, pe@@ stic@@ id@@ es to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture@@ s, chem@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il, chick@@ en to fish@@ , and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply as@@ ked, "If we're feed@@ ing more people more chea@@ pl@@ y, how terrible could that be@@ ?"
That's been the motiv@@ ation,
it's been the ju@@ sti@@ fic@@ ation@@ :
it's been the business plan of American agricul@@ ture.
We should call it what it is: a business in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation, a business that's quickly er@@ o@@ ding eco@@ logical capital that makes that very production possible.
That's not a business, and it isn't agricul@@ ture.
Our b@@ read@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ ened today, not because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing sup@@ pl@@ y, but because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing resourc@@ es. Not by the lat@@ est comb@@ ine and trac@@ tor inven@@ tion, but by fer@@ ti@@ le land@@ ; not by p@@ um@@ ps, but by f@@ res@@ h water@@ ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ w@@ s, but by fore@@ st@@ s; and not by fish@@ ing bo@@ ats and ne@@ ts, but by fish in the se@@ a.
W@@ ant to feed the world@@ ?
Let's start by as@@ k@@ ing: How are we going to feed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es?
Or bet@@ ter@@ : How can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed it@@ self@@ ?
To do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the future.
It's really old, and it's ti@@ red.
It's high on capit@@ al, chemistr@@ y and machin@@ es, and it's never produced anything really good to e@@ at.
Inste@@ ad, let's look to the eco@@ logical model@@ .
That's the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experience.
Look to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, farmers like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el. F@@ ar@@ ms that aren't worl@@ ds un@@ to them@@ sel@@ v@@ es; far@@ ms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te@@ ; far@@ ms that far@@ m ext@@ en@@ si@@ vely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y; farmers that are not just produc@@ ers, but exper@@ ts in relationshi@@ ps. Because they're the ones that are exper@@ ts in fla@@ v@@ or, too.
And if I'm going to be really hon@@ est@@ , they're a better che@@ f than I'll ever be.
You know, I'm oka@@ y with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be del@@ ici@@ ous.
Thank you.
I grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of science fic@@ tion.
In high school, I took a bu@@ s to school an hour each way every day.
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a book, science fic@@ tion book, which took my mind to other worl@@ ds, and s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed, in a n@@ arr@@ ative form@@ , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sense of curi@@ os@@ ity that I ha@@ d.
And you know, that curi@@ os@@ ity also man@@ if@@ est@@ ed itself in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wasn't in school I was out in the woo@@ ds, hi@@ king and taking "@@ sam@@ ple@@ s" -- fro@@ gs and s@@ na@@ kes and bu@@ gs and p@@ ond water -- and bringing it back, looking at it under the micro@@ scop@@ e.
You know, I was a real science ge@@ e@@ k.
But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the lim@@ its of possibil@@ ity.
And my love of science fic@@ tion actually seemed mir@@ ro@@ red in the world around me, because what was happen@@ ing, this was in the late '@@ 60@@ s, we were going to the mo@@ on, we were explor@@ ing the deep oce@@ ans. J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was coming into our living room@@ s with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ d@@ rou@@ s world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imagin@@ ed.
So, that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fic@@ tion part of it.
And I was an arti@@ st.
I could draw@@ . I could pain@@ t.
And I found that because there weren't video games and this s@@ atur@@ ation of C@@ G movi@@ es and all of this imag@@ ery in the media landscap@@ e, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, we all did, as kids having to read a book, and through the author@@ 's descri@@ p@@ tion, put something on the movie screen in our head@@ s.
And so, my response to this was to pain@@ t, to draw ali@@ en creature@@ s, ali@@ en worl@@ ds, robo@@ ts, spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps, all that stuff.
I was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the t@@ ext@@ book.
That was -- the creati@@ vity had to find its out@@ let some@@ how@@ .
And an interesting thing happen@@ ed@@ : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on Earth.
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day --
that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ li@@ k@@ ely.
But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that I had imag@@ ined from reading these boo@@ ks.
So, I decided I was going to become a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5.
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Can@@ ad@@ a, 6@@ 00 miles from the near@@ est oce@@ an.
But I didn't let that da@@ un@@ t me.
I pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ ub@@ a class in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k, right across the bor@@ der from where we li@@ ve.
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ o@@ l at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the dead of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k.
And I didn't see the oce@@ an, a real oce@@ an, for another two years, until we moved to Californi@@ a.
S@@ ince then, in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years, I've spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ water, and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble@@ s.
And I've learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment, and even the sh@@ allow oce@@ ans, are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagin@@ ation.
N@@ ature@@ 's imagin@@ ation is so bound@@ less compared to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imagin@@ ation.
I st@@ ill, to this day, stand in absol@@ ute a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves.
And my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ go@@ ing, and just as strong as it ever was.
But when I ch@@ ose a care@@ er as an adul@@ t, it was fil@@ m@@ ma@@ king.
And that seemed to be the best way to re@@ conc@@ ile this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create imag@@ es.
And I was, as a ki@@ d, const@@ antly draw@@ ing com@@ ic boo@@ ks, and so on.
So, fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories
together, and that made sense.
And of course the stories that I ch@@ ose to tell were science fic@@ tion stor@@ i@@ es: "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ ator@@ ," "A@@ li@@ en@@ s" and "The Ab@@ ys@@ s."
And with "The Ab@@ ys@@ s@@ ," I was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ ma@@ king.
So, you know, mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions.
Some@@ thing interesting came out of "The Ab@@ ys@@ s@@ ," which was that to solve a specific n@@ arr@@ ative problem on that fil@@ m, which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water creature@@ , we actually embr@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation, C@@ G@@ .
And this resul@@ ted in the first s@@ oft@@ -@@ surface charac@@ ter, C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a movi@@ e.
And even though the film didn't make any money -- b@@ are@@ ly bro@@ ke ev@@ en, I should say -- I wit@@ n@@ essed something amaz@@ ing, which is that the audi@@ ence, the global audi@@ ence, was mes@@ mer@@ ized by this app@@ ar@@ ent mag@@ ic.
You know, it's Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ k@@ e's law that any suff@@ ici@@ ently advanc@@ ed technology is in@@ dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from mag@@ ic.
They were seeing something mag@@ ic@@ al.
And so that got me very excit@@ ed.
And I thought, "W@@ ow, this is something that needs to be embr@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ atic ar@@ t."
So, with "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ ator 2@@ ," which was my next fil@@ m, we took that much far@@ ther.
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M@@ , we created the li@@ qu@@ id me@@ tal du@@ de in that fil@@ m. The success hun@@ g in the bal@@ ance on whether that effect would work.
And it did, and we created magic again,
and we had the same result with an audience --
although we did make a little more money on that one.
So, draw@@ ing a line through those two do@@ ts of experience came to, "This is going to be a whole new world@@ ," this was a whole new world of creati@@ vity for film arti@@ sts.
So, I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, my good friend St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and cre@@ ature design@@ er at that time, and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ ain@@ .
And the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g proc@@ esses of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on, and we would go right to digital produc@@ tion.
And we actually did that and it gave us a compet@@ itive adv@@ ant@@ age for a whi@@ le.
But we found ourselves l@@ ag@@ ging in the mi@@ d '9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ ature and character design stuff that we had actually f@@ ounded the company to do.
So, I wrote this piece called "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ velo@@ pe of visual effec@@ ts, of C@@ G effec@@ ts, bey@@ on@@ d, with real@@ istic human emo@@ tive charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G@@ , and the main charac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G@@ , and the world would be in C@@ G@@ .
And the en@@ velo@@ pe pus@@ hed back,
and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a whi@@ le.
So, I shel@@ ved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that s@@ in@@ ks.
You know, I went and pit@@ ched it to the studi@@ o as "@@ '@@ R@@ ome@@ o and Ju@@ li@@ et@@ ' on a shi@@ p@@ :
"@@ It's going to be this ep@@ ic rom@@ ance, pas@@ sionate fil@@ m@@ ."
Sec@@ re@@ t@@ ly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ."
And that's why I made the movi@@ e.
And that's the tru@@ th. Now, the studi@@ o didn't know that.
But I conv@@ inc@@ ed them. I said, "@@ We're going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k. We're going to film it for real@@ .
We@@ 'll be using it in the open@@ ing of the fil@@ m.
It will be really important. It will be a great marke@@ ting hoo@@ k@@ ."
And I talked them into fun@@ ding an ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ on.
S@@ ounds craz@@ y. But this goes back to that the@@ me about your imagin@@ ation creating a real@@ ity.
Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a Russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic@@ , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a view por@@ t. Not a movi@@ e, not H@@ D -- for real@@ .
Now, that ble@@ w my mind.
And it took a lot of prepar@@ ation, we had to build camer@@ as and li@@ ghts and all kinds of things.
But, it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve, these deep di@@ ves, was like a space mis@@ sion.
You know, where it was highly techn@@ ical, and it requi@@ red enormous plan@@ ning.
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le, you go down to this dark ho@@ st@@ ile environment where there is no hope of resc@@ ue if you can't get back by your@@ self.
And I thought like, "W@@ ow. I'm like, living in a science fic@@ tion movi@@ e.
This is really cool@@ ."
And so, I really got b@@ itt@@ en by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ ocean explor@@ ation.
Of course, the curi@@ os@@ ity, the science compon@@ ent of it --
it was everything. It was adv@@ ent@@ ure@@ ,
it was curi@@ os@@ ity, it was imagin@@ ation.
And it was an experience that H@@ olly@@ wood couldn't give me.
Bec@@ au@@ se, you know, I could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that wind@@ ow.
As we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ ons, I was seeing creature@@ s at hydro@@ ther@@ m@@ al v@@ ents and sometimes things that I had never seen before, sometimes things that no one had seen before, that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them.
So, I was completely sm@@ itt@@ en by this, and had to do more.
And so, I actually made a kind of curi@@ ous deci@@ sion.
After the success of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ," I said, "@@ OK, I'm going to par@@ k my day job as a H@@ olly@@ wood movie ma@@ k@@ er, and I'm going to go be a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time explo@@ re@@ r for a whi@@ le@@ ."
And so, we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ ons.
And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k, and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehic@@ les.
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k.
We took little bo@@ ts that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ ve@@ y of that shi@@ p, which had never been done.
No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it.
So, you know, here I am now, on the dec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic, sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had pla@@ ye@@ d.
And I'm flying a little robo@@ tic vehic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p.
When I say, "I'm oper@@ ating it@@ ," but my mind is in the vehic@@ le.
I felt like I was phys@@ ically present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic.
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experience I've ever ha@@ d, because I would know before I turned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ ghts of the vehic@@ le actually reve@@ al@@ ed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movi@@ e.
And the set was based as an ex@@ act replic@@ a on the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ in@@ ts of the shi@@ p.
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.
And it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ar@@ s, then your conscious@@ ness is in@@ jec@@ ted into the vehic@@ le, into this other form of exist@@ ence.
It was really, really quite prof@@ ound.
And it may be a little bit of a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se as to what might be happening some decad@@ es out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodi@@ es for explor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of po@@ st-@@ human fu@@ tures that I can imag@@ ine, as a science fic@@ tion f@@ an.
So, having done these ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ ons, and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there, such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amaz@@ ing, amazing animals --
they're basically ali@@ ens right here on Earth.
They live in an environment of ch@@ emo@@ synthe@@ si@@ s.
They don't survive on sun@@ light@@ -@@ based system the way we do.
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 00@@ -@@ degre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de water pl@@ um@@ es.
You think they can't possibly exist@@ .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science fic@@ tion influ@@ ence, as a ki@@ d.
And I w@@ ound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NAS@@ A, sitting on the NAS@@ A ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y boar@@ d, plan@@ ning actual space mis@@ sions, going to Russi@@ a, going through the pre@@ -@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical proto@@ col@@ s, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D camera system@@ s.
And this was fascin@@ ating.
But what I w@@ ound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep@@ .
And taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ bio@@ logi@@ sts, planet@@ ary scienti@@ sts, people who were interested in these extre@@ me environment@@ s -- taking them down to the v@@ ents, and let@@ ting them see, and take sam@@ p@@ les and test instrum@@ ents, and so on.
So, here we were making docum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science.
I'd completely clo@@ sed the loo@@ p between being the science fic@@ tion f@@ an, you know, as a ki@@ d, and doing this stuff for real@@ .
And you know, along the way in this journey of discover@@ y, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p.
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a lead@@ er, lead@@ er of, cap@@ tain of the shi@@ p, and all that sort of thing.
I didn't really learn about lead@@ er@@ ship until I did these ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ ons.
Because I had to, at a certain point, say, "What am I doing out here?
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it@@ ?"
We don't make money at these dam@@ n show@@ s.
We b@@ are@@ ly break ev@@ en. There is no f@@ ame in it.
People sort of think I went away between "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ " and "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ " and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ail@@ s some@@ place, sitting at the be@@ ach@@ .
M@@ ade all these fil@@ ms, made all these docum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very lim@@ ited audi@@ ence.
No fam@@ e, no gl@@ or@@ y, no money. What are you do@@ ing?
You're doing it for the t@@ ask it@@ self, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challeng@@ ing environment there is -- for the thr@@ ill of discover@@ y, and for that strange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am.
Because we would do these things with 10@@ , 12 people, working for years at a time,
sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.
And in that bon@@ d, you realize that the most important thing is the respec@@ t that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a t@@ ask that you can't explain to someone else.
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say, "We had to do this, and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficul@@ ty, the human@@ -@@ perform@@ ance as@@ pec@@ ts of working at se@@ a@@ ," you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cop@@ s have, or people in comb@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it.
C@@ re@@ ates a bon@@ d, creates a b@@ ond of respec@@ t.
So, when I came back to make my next movi@@ e, which was "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tried to apply that same princi@@ ple of lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p, which is that you respec@@ t your te@@ am, and you ear@@ n their respec@@ t in re@@ tur@@ n.
And it really changed the dynam@@ ic.
So, here I was again with a small te@@ am, in un@@ char@@ ted terr@@ itor@@ y, doing "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," coming up with new technology that didn't ex@@ ist before.
T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ously excit@@ ing.
T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ously challeng@@ ing.
And we became a famil@@ y, over a four@@ -@@ and-@@ half year perio@@ d.
And it completely changed how I do movi@@ es.
So, people have com@@ ment@@ ed on h@@ ow, "Well, you know, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a@@ ."
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process it@@ self, that changed as a result of that.
So, what can we synthe@@ size out of all this?
You know, what are the less@@ ons lear@@ ne@@ d?
Well, I think number one is curi@@ os@@ ity.
It's the most powerful thing you own.
Imag@@ in@@ ation is a force that can actually man@@ if@@ est a real@@ ity.
And the respec@@ t of your team is more important than all the la@@ ure@@ ls in the world.
I have young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ kers come up to me and say, "@@ G@@ ive me some adv@@ ice for doing this@@ ."
And I say, "@@ Don't put lim@@ it@@ ations on your@@ self.
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don't do it to your@@ self, don't be@@ t against your@@ self,
and take ri@@ sk@@ s."
NAS@@ A has this ph@@ r@@ ase that they like@@ : "@@ F@@ ail@@ ure is not an op@@ tion@@ ."
But fail@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in explor@@ ation, because it's a lea@@ p of fai@@ th.
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that requi@@ red innovation was done without ris@@ k.
You have to be willing to take those ri@@ sk@@ s.
So, that's the thought I would leave you with, is that in whatever you're doing, fail@@ ure is an op@@ tion, but fear is not. Thank you.
If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we consum@@ e is greater that the sum of the par@@ ts, and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ ad, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ ends that would other@@ wise be in@@ vi@@ si@@ ble.
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mor@@ tal@@ ity char@@ t organ@@ ized by age.
This tool that I'm using here is a little experim@@ ent.
It's called P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, and with P@@ i@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths -- say, accid@@ ents.
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerg@@ es.
This is because, in the mid@@ -@@ area here, people are at their most ac@@ tive, and over here they're at their most f@@ ra@@ il.
We can step back out again and then re@@ organ@@ ize the data by cause of dea@@ th, seeing that cir@@ cul@@ atory disea@@ ses and cancer are the us@@ ual sus@@ pec@@ ts, but not for every@@ one.
If we go ahead and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accid@@ ents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be wor@@ ried about.
And if you dr@@ ill into that, it's especially the case for m@@ en.
So you get the idea that view@@ ing information, view@@ ing data in this way, is a lot like swim@@ ming in a living information inf@@ o-@@ graph@@ ic.
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data, why not do it for content as well@@ ?
So what we have right here is the cover of every single S@@ por@@ ts I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed.
It's all her@@ e; it's all on the web@@ .
You can go back to your room@@ s and try this after my tal@@ k.
With P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, you can dr@@ ill into a decad@@ e.
You can dr@@ ill into a particular year.
You can jum@@ p right into a specific issu@@ e.
So I'm looking at this@@ ; I see the ath@@ let@@ es that have appear@@ ed in this issu@@ e, the spor@@ ts.
I'm a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ strong f@@ an, so I'll go ahead and I'll cl@@ ick on that, which reve@@ als, for me, all the issues in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ strong@@ 's been a part of.
Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at the@@ se, I might think, "Well, what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing@@ ?"
So I can step back, and exp@@ and on that.
And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ M@@ ond now.
And so you get the idea that when you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate over information this way -- going nar@@ row@@ er, broad@@ er, bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out -- you're not se@@ arch@@ ing, you're not b@@ row@@ s@@ ing.
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.
It's in betwe@@ en, and we think it changes the way information can be use@@ d.
So I want to extra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit craz@@ y.
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedi@@ a page and we reduc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y. So the sum@@ mar@@ y consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes fr@@ om.
I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedi@@ a p@@ ages right here.
But even in this lim@@ ited view, we can do a lot of things.
Ri@@ ght away, we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ ain@@ s that are most popular on Wikipedi@@ a.
I'm going to go ahead and selec@@ t govern@@ ment.
Now, having selec@@ ted govern@@ ment, I can now see that the Wikipedi@@ a c@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respon@@ d to that are Tim@@ e magaz@@ ine People of the Y@@ ear@@ .
So this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not con@@ tain@@ ed within any one Wikipedi@@ a p@@ age.
It's only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them.
Loo@@ king at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies, I can then dr@@ ill into the concept of Tim@@ e magaz@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ ear@@ ,
bringing up all of them.
So looking at these people, I can see that the maj@@ ority come from govern@@ ment@@ ; some have come from natural sci@@ enc@@ es; som@@ e, fe@@ w@@ er st@@ ill, have come from business --
there's my bo@@ ss --
and one has come from music.
And interest@@ ingly enough, B@@ on@@ o is also a TED Pri@@ ze win@@ n@@ er.
So we can go, jum@@ p, and take a look at all the TED Pri@@ ze win@@ n@@ ers.
So you see, we're na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web@@ , not from pa@@ ge@@ -@@ to-@@ p@@ age, but at a higher level of abstr@@ ac@@ tion.
And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surpri@@ se.
I'm just showing the New York Tim@@ es web@@ site here.
So P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, this applic@@ ation -- I don't want to call it a b@@ row@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a b@@ row@@ s@@ er, but you can view web p@@ ages with it -- and we bring that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this.
So I can step back, po@@ p right back into a specific sec@@ tion. Now the reason why this is important is because, by virtu@@ e of just view@@ ing web p@@ ages in this way, I can look at my entire b@@ row@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way.
So I can dr@@ ill into what I've done over specific time fram@@ es.
Her@@ e, in fact, is the state of all the dem@@ o that I just ga@@ ve.
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at earli@@ er today.
And, if I want to step back and look at every@@ thing, I can sl@@ ice and d@@ ice my history, perhaps by my search history --
here, I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic se@@ arch@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ vo@@ t.
